 ## What is Covalon?
}}


{{wide 
Covalon is a "living world" style tabletop RPG campaign, using the Pathfinder 2e system, with a focus on providing drop-in/drop-out style adventures and role play in a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. Our unique campaign weaves a cohesive and open narrative from the backstory and role play contributions of the players with a focus on slow and relaxed progression, giving everyone a chance to enjoy the campaign and develop their chaorracter at their own pace. Individual adventures are jam-packed with combat and intrigue without affecting an overarching plot, which allows characters to have engaging experiences without needing to worry atrbout missing out on a grander narrative. Whether you choose to play with us daily or once a week, Covalon offers fulfilling gameplay for everyone! To make this cohesive setting work, we have some special rules that you may find different from normal campaigns. In general, we try to stick to rules-as-written (RAW) as much as possible, in order to ensure that scheduled play sessions (universally referred to as "adventures" in Covalon) are run as fairly and consistently as possible between our many Game Masters (universally referred to as "dungeon guides" in Covalon). While we encourage players to invent civilizations and deities to fill out our setting, we place strict limits on homebrewed mechanical features, such as items and class features, and we do not use certain optional rules such as voluntary flaws, free archetypes, and dual classing. There are, of course, some exceptions to these rules, which can be found in this ever-updating document. [Click here to join Covalon!](https://discord.gg/covalon)

All players must be 18 years of age or older. In addition to this, all characters must be of adult age for their species in order to prevent uncomfortable role playing situations.

This is a diverse community of many countries, cultures, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, and beliefs. Disrespectful talk of any kind will not be tolerated.

### 3. Prohibited Themes

Although the minimum age requirement to join the server is 18, all out of character conversations and role playing themes must be kept appropriate for a PG-13 rating. Additionally, the following topics and themes are not permitted to be discussed or role played on the server

Finally, please limit discussion of your personal difficulties within Covalon. We are a supportive community, but the primary goal of the server is to roll dice and have fun.

### 4. Respect Other Users

Do not threaten or harass other users. This includes "doxxing," or revealing any private information about a player without their consent. It also includes pressuring another player to sell, give away, or donate items they receive from an adventure. Do not engage in unsolicited or unwanted sexual advances or conversations of a personal sexual nature. These types of conversations should be limited to Discord direct messaging, and only after receiving the explicit consent of all involved users.

#### Managing Conflicts between players
Despite our best efforts, sometimes we come into conflict with others. You can find guidance on how Covalon manages conflicts between players in [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_qpEsvT58OKODNMlMV5kV43A9LB8gNUUaLYXaOJm9_g/edit?usp=sharing)

### 5. Additional Discord Accounts

Covalon does not allow players to have multiple Discord accounts within the server.

### 6. Self-Promotion

Self-promotion should be kept to a reasonable limit, and should use the proper channels. For example, if you want to advertise your artistic talents, use the #artwork channel.

### 7. Questions and Concerns

All suggestions for the server or sensitive concerns should be brought to the private attention of the Administrator and Moderator teams via the ticket system, which can be accessed via the #create-a-ticket channel in the Discord server.
