<p>##Running games in Covalon
Covalon is a living world server, and as a result there are many differences in comparison to a traditional home game among friends. As a core tenet, we try to keep the experience of games between adventures consistent and we try to make the experience of running games as enjoyable as possible. At its most basic, this means four things:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-host-when-you-want-to-host-when-you-want-to">1. Host when you want to ((+Host When You Want To))<a href="#1-host-when-you-want-to-host-when-you-want-to" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Host when you want to ((+Host When You Want To))" title="Direct link to 1. Host when you want to ((+Host When You Want To))">​</a></h2>
<p>As a Dungeon Guide, you choose when you run your adventures. There is no quota of games you are expected to host, and you can run any type of game you wish to run. You may run as often or as infrequently as your time and motivation allows.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-consistency-of-games-consistency-of-games">2. Consistency of Games ((+Consistency of Games))<a href="#2-consistency-of-games-consistency-of-games" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Consistency of Games ((+Consistency of Games))" title="Direct link to 2. Consistency of Games ((+Consistency of Games))">​</a></h2>
<p>Our game types, explained in greater detail below, have guidelines on how to build encounters, settings and treasure piles to ensure that the experience across the server is consistent. In this way, players have a good understanding of what to expect when they sign up to play a game.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-give-it-to-me-raw-give-it-to-me-raw">3. Give It To Me RAW! ((+Give It To Me RAW!))<a href="#3-give-it-to-me-raw-give-it-to-me-raw" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Give It To Me RAW! ((+Give It To Me RAW!))" title="Direct link to 3. Give It To Me RAW! ((+Give It To Me RAW!))">​</a></h2>
<p>We use Rules As Written (RAW) rulings as much as possible to reduce the burden on Dungeon Guides of needing to learn a multitude of server-specific rules in order to run games. You should be able to run an adventure and reference core rules of the game in order to make mid-session judgements if needed without having to reference a thousand other documents.</p>
<p>There are however occasions in which we have made non-RAW rulings in order to better fit a Living World Campaign. These can be found in the #!?Rule-Clarifications-and-faqs channel.</p>

<h1>As a Covalon Dungeon Guide you have full autonomy to choose who sits at your table. You will never be mandated to run for specific people or groups, and we will never implement server systems that impact who you take at your table.</h1>

<h1>Roles</h1>
<p>There are 3 key roles for Dungeon Guides in Covalon:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aspiring Dungeon Guides</strong> - Individuals that have expressed an interest in running games in Covalon and have yet to complete their shadowed adventure(s).</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Guides</strong> - Individuals that have completed their shadowing and have a good understanding of Covalon&#x27;s systems.</li>
<li><strong>Senior Dungeon Guides</strong> - Highly trusted, experienced Dungeon Guides who have demonstrated a clear understanding of Covalon&#x27;s ethos and no longer need to submit their adventures for approval before running a game!
)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for taking the first step to running games for us! As an Aspiring Dungeon Guide you are in the process of learning how games are set up on the server.</p>
<p>Aspiring Dungeon Guides should read through this guide in its entirety before submitting their first game for approval.</p>
<p>Once you have completed your adventure outline, Create A Ticket to submit it for approval. Your first adventure approval ticket must include:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-adventure-outline-adventure-outline">Your Adventure Outline ((+Adventure Outline))<a href="#your-adventure-outline-adventure-outline" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your Adventure Outline ((+Adventure Outline))" title="Direct link to Your Adventure Outline ((+Adventure Outline))">​</a></h2>
<p>This can be as simple as a block of text, or utilising one of the tools created by the community for adventure submissions. As a minimum, this must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hook that players will see in your #Scheduled-Events Post. This should be the call to adventure provided by your portal specialist.</li>
<li>All of the monsters and hazards that the players will face, including links to Archives of Nethys entries</li>
<li>All of the treasure the players will receive</li>
<li>A breakdown of the narrative of the dungeon</li>
<li>Any other specific details that the staff team should know about, including potential trigger warnings or themes.</li>
</ul>
<p>note (
##A great tool to use to structure this outline can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I_sD6f8Qe66KtikEvpC7x3fxVVeBptZWDsxcmHbDROI/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!

<p>Every Dungeon Guide creates their own Portal Specialist NPC. This is an individual who works for the Dungeoneering Society and provides quests and guidance to the party. They are also responsible for opening and sustaining the portal to take adventurers to the quest location. Your Portal Specialist must be cooperative with the party, and invested in their success. You should submit a brief summary of their personality and a description of their appearance for approval.</p>
<p>Your player character cannot be a portal specialist.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scheduling-a-shadow-scheduling-a-shadow">Scheduling A Shadow ((+Scheduling A Shadow))<a href="#scheduling-a-shadow-scheduling-a-shadow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scheduling A Shadow ((+Scheduling A Shadow))" title="Direct link to Scheduling A Shadow ((+Scheduling A Shadow))">​</a></h2>
<p>In your ticket, submit two proposed times on non-consecutive days that you are able to run the adventure along with the time you intend to run. As an Aspiring Dungeon Guide you must be shadowed by a Moderator when you run games, and providing two days and times increases the likelihood someone will be available to shadow you.</p>
<p>Once you are approved and have a moderator ready, you&#x27;re good to run your adventure! The shadowing moderator will keep your ticket open to provide you feedback after your adventure.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="core-rules">Core Rules<a href="#core-rules" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Core Rules" title="Direct link to Core Rules">​</a></h2>
<p>Before starting to design games for Covalon, it is strongly recommended that you read through <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chapter 9</a> and [chapter 10] (<a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=480</a>) of the Core Rulebook. This includes the core rules of the system in terms of creating encounters that are balanced, challenging and fun!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="apl-and-party-size-apl-and-party-size">APL and Party Size ((+APL and Party Size))<a href="#apl-and-party-size-apl-and-party-size" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to APL and Party Size ((+APL and Party Size))" title="Direct link to APL and Party Size ((+APL and Party Size))">​</a></h2>
<p>When designing a game adventure, you should start with determining your Average Party Level (APL). You can do this by working out the average of your party members if you know them in advance, or selecting an APL in advance you expect to have.</p>
<p>Most adventures in Covalon assume <strong>6 players</strong> in attendance. You can run an adventure with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 players.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your party size will impact your <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experience Budget</a>. Sometimes you will find that the average party level of a group is in the middle of two whole levels. In the event of finding you have a party of a 0.5 interval, you should balance for one additional player of the lower level. For example, if you have a party of six with an APL of 6.5, you should balance for 7 level 6 characters.</p>

#Level 1 Characters
Level 1 characters are especially fragile. When a first level character is present, no creatures above level 3 can be used.
)
It&#x27;s time to select your creatures! For most Covalon game modes, you need to design for Moderate difficulty encounters. [This page] (<a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=497" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=497</a>) is the perfect place to check the experience values of monsters you are selecting for your challenges. Keep in mind you cannot select a monster that is more than 3 levels above the lowest level player in the party. Keep this in mind when designing encounters, especially if you don&#x27;t know who your players are yet.</p>
<p>Of course, monsters aren&#x27;t the only challenges your players will face. You can find the experience costs of <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hazards here</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may wish to use particular environments, weather, magical terrain or other non-creature, non-hazard considerations within your adventure. This should be included within your approval, and often will require an experience value associated with it. The experience value should be proportionate to how heavily it will affect the party. A large patch of difficult terrain might only be 10 experience, but a patch of Energy Surge Terrain with on-type monsters might be worth 20 or more experience.</p>
<p>Always make sure to double check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CFU66rjnT7x-91z630Dg9P4_hTRFr25dCOWVqGvx6Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restricted Monsters</a> list for any experience adjustments that need to be made for certain monsters in Covalon adventures!</p>
<p>Note (
#Custom Creatures
Rarely you may not find a creature that fits the theme of the adventure you are running, or the creatures that <em>do</em> fit are the wrong level.</p>
<p>In these cases you can use the [Building Creatures] (<a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=995</a>) rules in order to create or scale a custom creature. When doing so, please submit the full statblock as part of your approval.

<p>Unless specified otherwise in the game type instructions, all adventures in Covalon must follow the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player gets one Hero Point at the start of the adventure, up to the usual maximum of 3 if they already have any. Unlike other Hero Points, if this Hero Point is not used by the end of the adventure it is lost.</li>

#One Permanent Item
It is important to keep in mind that players can only select a maximum of one permanent item from each adventure, so don&#x27;t add more than the number of players you have or it will go to waste!
)</p>
<p>Selecting loot for your adventure is a critical part of its design! Below, you will find the rules and guidelines for selecting loot and treasure for your Covalon adventures. Keep in mind the theme of your dungeon, and take a look through the available items and equipment in order to select thematically appropriate loot.</p>
<p>The total value of loot for each APL value can be found in table 3-1 and 3-2. Underneath, you will find loot guidelines to ensure your submission will be approved!</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the above tables are for a 6 person party. You will need to adjust for a lower number of party members if you are running for fewer than 6 players! You can do this by dividing the above figures by 6, and multiplying the resulting number by the total number of players you will be running for.</p>
<p>rules(For example, if you planned to run an APL 9 patrol for 5 players, you would divide 2142 by 6 to get 357. You then multiply 357 by 5 for a total loot budget for the adventure of 1785g.
)
/</p>
<p>##Loot should contain:((+Adventure Loot))</p>
<p>###Gold and Treasure
Cash is great! At least 50% of the treasure budget must be gold to ensure people can buy or commission items they want instead of relying on drops.</p>
<p>###Consumable Items
Bombs, mutagens, elixirs, potions, scrolls, talismans are great rewards that players will often not craft for themselves.</p>
<p>###Basic Permanent Items
Basic weapons and armor are good additions. In particular, relevant uncommon weapons are a good reward for an appropriately set dungeon.</p>
<p>###Appropriately Levelled Formulas and Items
Crafting is the main source of permanent items in Covalon, and formulas are an excellent way to facilitate that. Formulas and items given as loot should be the same level or lower than the APL of the party. For example, an APL 7 party receives item level 7 loot and cannot receive level 8+ loot.</p>
<p>note (
Up to 2 formulas can be included as loot for an appropriately themed dungeon. When distributing loot at the end of a adventure, a formula is not considered a permanent item and can be directly donated to Covalon!
)</p>
<p>###Wands of spells that need heightening to scale
This basically means anything that deals damage or heals is great. Avoid long-term buffs like Longstrider, etc.</p>
<p>###Rings, capes, and other magical accessores
Permanent magic items that are not weapons, armor, staves, or other high-priority items are acceptable for non-patrol adventures only. This can be rings, cloaks, boots, bags, aeon-stones, and other universal magical accessories.
|</p>
<p>##Loot should not contain: ((+Disallowed Loot))</p>
<p>###Specific Magic Weapons, Armor, Staves and Runes
These would be more appropriate as a formula for people to create themselves in Covalon. An exception to this rule is made for Tier 1 and Tier 2 adventures, and you are encouraged to include fundamental runes as loot in these adventures.</p>
<p>###Formulas of Items Higher Level than the Adventure
Formulas for items higher level than the APL of the adventure should not be given out.</p>
<p>###Homebrew Items That Provide Mechanical Benefits
We stick to RAW as much as possible. This helps to provide consistency for the other Dungeon Guides so we do not need to keep track of lots of different magical items that cannot be easily looked up.</p>
<p>###Universally Useful Wands
Longstrider, Resist Energy, Circle of Protection and other universally useful spells that do not scale with levels should be crafted and not dropped.</p>
<p>###Stasian Technology
The technology level for the Covalon setting is ‘Gunpowder and Clockwork’ and Stasian Technology is too advanced for this purpose.</p>
<p>###Disallowed Items
Any items marked as disallowed on our server whitelist, which can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yUXF_IAmpim6wkB7QT5l6K_lS5DgOppv99BHjMYbNIU/edit#gid=2120003232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

#Singular Sessions
All adventures must be entirely self-contained. You may not run an adventure that is a sequel, prequel or otherwise narratively linked to another adventure.</p>
<p>This ensures that players do not miss out because they were unable to attend a previous adventure!
)</p>
<p>Dungeons are a game type initiated as a mission from the Dungeoneering Society. Your Portal Specialist transports the party to faraway lands via portal magic to investigate mysteries, gather supplies and defeat dangers.</p>
<p>A dungeon generally consists of three moderate encounters that are appropriate for the Average Party Level. These adventures generally take about 3 hours and must not go longer than 4 hours. Activities besides combat may be budgeted as an encounter, such as a trap, a puzzle, a social encounter, or exploration/travel, with approval in your approval ticket.</p>
<p>note (
#A Note on Experience
Remember that the experience budget for a dungeon is 250 <strong>pre-adjusted</strong> experience. This means that for a party of 4 you have 250 experience to spend on challeneges. For a party of 6, you have around 375 experience to spend and a moderate encounter has a budget of 120 experience!</p>
<p>You can double check the experience for different party sizes <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>
)</p>
<p>##Patrols ((+Patrols))</p>
<p>Covalon Patrols  are small adventures and missions that take place in the immediate vicinity of Covalon-controlled locations.</p>
<p>A patrol consists of a single moderate combat encounter, and is expected to last no more than an hour. Patrols should have little to no narrative elements or non-combat encounters.</p>
<p>Patrols never contain permanent magic items as loot, but magical consumables (such as talismans, potions, scrolls, etc) are allowed.</p>
<p>info (</p>
<h1>Patrol Locations</h1>
<p>##Tier 1
Patrols for levels 1-3 take place in the immediate vicinity around Covalon. They must not take place inside the city walls.</p>
<p>##Tier 2
Patrols for level 4-6 take place around the Maw near Covalon. Monsters for Tier 2 patrols should be themed or described as corrupted or influenced by the Maw in some way. This does not change their statblocks and is for narrative reasons only.</p>
<p>##Tier 3
Patrols for levels 7-9 take place in the immediate vicinity of our Expedition Camps. They must not take place inside the camps, and monsters should be themed around the locale of the expedition.
)</p>
<p>##Expeditions ((+Expeditions))
Expedition missions are a special game-mode that is heavily intertwined with the ongoing meta-narrative of Covalon, beyond gathering supplies and going through portals. Expeditions represent our efforts to reclaim the world after the Cataclysm and face the challenges left behind in a shattered realm.</p>
<p>Expeditions require the installation of the Covalon Expedition Module on Foundry.</p>
<p>Expeditions consist of a choice of three missions that have special instructions that can be found inside the Module.</p>
<p>###Finales ((++Finales))
Expedition Finales are a single boss encounter with special mechanics that are narratively tied to defending the planted Seeds of Terra used to purify reclaimed areas of the world map from Maw monsters. Check out the Expedition Module for more details on how to run each finale!</p>
<p>##Descents ((+Descents))
A Descent may currently only be run by Senior DGs and Administrators. These adventures are exclusively for the current highest tier of play, and always balanced for the maximum level players in Covalon can achieve.</p>
<p>Descents are composed of up to four single-room encounters. After clearing a room, players may make the decision to continue onward to the next room or retreat with any rewards they have collected so far.</p>
<p>After clearing a room, each player may undertake one 10-minute activity.</p>
<p>Descents have a maximum time limit of 4 hours. If the third encounter is completed with less than 45 minutes remaining the party may not continue. The race against the clock is part of the challenge!</p>
<p>Descents are composed of combat encounters exclusively. No narrative, puzzles, exploration, or roleplay will be present.</p>
<p>Clearing at least one room rewards the party with 250 experience in total and 1376 gp per room per player. These gp rewards should be flavored as &quot;Maw Stones&quot; that Arto uses Covalon Funds to purchase from the players.</p>
<p>The first encounter in a Descent is moderate difficulty. Each subsequent encounter must be severe difficulty. The restricted monster list does not apply to Descents, and you may use more sinister environments when designing Descent rooms.</p>
<p>Descents are usually run for 6 players, but can be run for a party of smaller than 6. Encounters should still be balanced as Moderate for the first encounter, and then Severe for each subsequent room. The time limit is reduced by 15 minutes per player less than 6.</p>
<p>##Brawls ((+Brawls))</p>
<p>Specific PVP events where two teams of three players face off against each other are brawls. Brawls may only be hosted by Senior Dungeon Guides.</p>
<p>Brawls are always run on the <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/839560408075075615/909255807785369600/Brawl_Arena_GM.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arena map</a>. (Use a grid size of 128 pixels.) One team starts in the red square in the top right and the other team starts in the blue square in the top left. All platforms are 10 feet high. The DC to climb any ladder or rigging is 10, but magical oil is applied to the sides of all platforms to make climbing more difficult; use a level-based DC based on the average player level for climbing the sides of platforms. For control points, the three yellow squares indicate the control points, while the blue flag in the top-left and the red flag in the bottom-right indicate the locations of the blue and red flags respectively, as well as the scoring locations for the blue and red teams, respectively.</p>
<p>All participants in Brawl gain Gold and experience, even if they lose. The winning team each receives a Gladiator Token for prestige. For more information on brawls, check the Brawl listing in the Player&#x27;s Guide <a href="https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/8vMfPSF7-covalon-player-s-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>###Duels ((++Duels))
Players may participate in 1v1 friendly duels after getting approval via a PvP ticket. Any Dungeon Guide can host a duel. Duels do not provide any rewards for dungeon guides or participants, and the rules of the duel should be defined by the participants.</p>
<p>You must confirm with the participants that they have had their duel approved in a ticket before proceeding.</p>

<p>Before you can run adventures, you must first have a Portal Specialists approved via a ticket. Portal specialists are the workers of the dungeoneering society that work tirelessly identifying, testing and using portal keys to send players on adventures. Specialists open portals during portal key testing and briefly scout the surrounding area to get a sense of how valuable the area is... and how dangerous.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="portal-keys-portal-keys">Portal Keys ((+Portal Keys))<a href="#portal-keys-portal-keys" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Portal Keys ((+Portal Keys))" title="Direct link to Portal Keys ((+Portal Keys))">​</a></h2>
<p>Portals are opened by using &quot;portal keys,&quot; which can be any small object, but most tend to be objects with a strong connection to a physical place in the world. Good candidates have strong, but narrow, &quot;object memory.&quot; Objects with broad &quot;object memory&quot; might open a portal anywhere in the world (such as a gold piece that has been traded through dozens of trade ports). But the location that a portal opens to is also affected by two other major factors: strong emotions and ley lines.</p>

<p>It is possible to use a living creature as a portal key. This was only ever done once in Covalon, using a captured goblin raider as a portal key to attempt to find the location of the goblin raiding camp that was causing the city trouble. The goblin didn&#x27;t appear to suffer any ill effects as a result of being a focus for the key, but our specialists theorise that the practice could permanently shatter the mind of the creature serving as a key. Thus, using a living creature as a portal key is a felony in Covalon.

<p>All new characters to the dungeoneering society must sign a dungeoneering contract before they can complete <em>any</em> adventures on behalf of Covalon. This is a great opportunity to have people introduce their character to a group, and a copy of the contract can be found [here!] (<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/839560408075075615/898235432758812692/DungeoneeringSociety.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/839560408075075615/898235432758812692/DungeoneeringSociety.png</a>)</p>

<p>Areas where strong emotions were released tend to magnetize portals to those areas. For example, say a village burned to the ground during the cataclysm and all the villagers were incinerated in a matter of minutes. The screams of terror and pain from the villagers would create a strong emotional magnet that might influence a portal key more than anything else in its object memory (hence why many portals tend to open to ruins or other sites of tragedy). The other major factor that influences portals are ley lines, which are invisible loci of magical power scattered across the world. Ley line interference is highly unpredictable, and can cause portals to open quite a distance off from the source of the object memory feeding the portal. As a result, it is impossible to &quot;pinpoint&quot; a specific location with portals.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="holding-portals-open-holding-portals-open">Holding Portals Open ((+Holding Portals Open))<a href="#holding-portals-open-holding-portals-open" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Holding Portals Open ((+Holding Portals Open))" title="Direct link to Holding Portals Open ((+Holding Portals Open))">​</a></h2>
<p>Once a portal is opened, it must be receive a constant flow of magical energy in order to remain stable. Portal specialists are capable of keeping portals open, though keeping one open for too long can cause quite a bit of strain on the spellcaster. For this reason, excursions should be kept to no more than a few hours in length.</p>
<p>rules(
This is also a great, in-universe way to keep the party moving inside an adventure and prevent excessive stalling or delaying tactics.

<p>After a portal key has been used and an excursion has been finished, portal specialists are instructed to destroy the portal key. This ensures that a portal key is not accidentally used again (as an excursion to somewhere that&#x27;s already been cleaned out would be a waste of time) and keeps powerful entities from tracking Covalonians when they return home. As long as the portal specialist doesn&#x27;t come into contact with any creatures while scouting, the portal key is not destroyed during testing.</p>

<p>##Purpose ((+Purpose))
The primary purpose of Covalon&#x27;s adventures is to explore the world, gather valuable supplies to ensure the city&#x27;s continued survival and to fight dangerous threats in order to achieve those goals. Try to keep this in mind when themeing your adventure hooks and narrative.</p>
<p>Try to avoid scenarios in which Covalon is explicitly attempting to rescue or improve a location, outside of Expedition missions. Part of the setting means that we don&#x27;t fully know what&#x27;s out there until we get there!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="locations-locations">Locations ((+Locations))<a href="#locations-locations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Locations ((+Locations))" title="Direct link to Locations ((+Locations))">​</a></h2>
<p>The location of your adventure is one of the most important considerations after your encounter design and loot. The setting of Covalon allows for a wide variety of locations for your adventure to be set, but there are still some constraints in place to keep the feel of a post-Cataclysm world.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="post-cataclysm">Post-Cataclysm<a href="#post-cataclysm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Post-Cataclysm" title="Direct link to Post-Cataclysm">​</a></h3>
<p>The Cataclysm wiped out all known civilisations, with only scattered individual survivors. Covalon is the largest settlement that presently exists, and so it&#x27;s important to keep this in mind when designing for an adventure. You adventure can include some small number of NPCs, but it is important not to create an implication of large pockets of survivors after the Cataclysm.</p>
<p>note(
#Living in a Material World
All adventures must take place on the material plane. Covalon is not a multi-planar campaign, although localised planar influences may be permitted if the narrative remains cohesive with the wider setting. Make sure to include any details in your ticket!

<p>Including NPCs in your adventure can allow for the inclusion of social encounters or just prime opportunities for roleplay. These NPCs must be included in your approval ticket if they are present. In order to keep with the post-Cataclysm setting, there should be no more than a handful of NPCs included in an adventure submission.</p>
<p>It is important that NPCs never return to Covalon. They must have their own motivations or reasons for this in order to prevent the town becoming a dumping ground of NPCs.</p>
<p>Note(
#Shopkeepers and Merchants
You may submit a shopkeeper or merchant NPC for use in your adventures as one of the few permitted recurring elements for adventures. Shopkeepers may only sell consumables, and they should be sold at a 5-15% markup from their listed price. Shopkeepers may only sell items on the allowlist.</p>
<p>Items sold by shopkeepers do not reduce the treasure budget of the adventure they are included in, as their items cost gold.

<p>The level of technology for the setting can be summarised as &#x27;Gunpowder and Clockwork&#x27;. Stasian technology is too advanced, and even the most advanced pre-Cataclysm civilisations were only in the very early stages of industrialisation.</p>
<p>This means that settings that include heavy sci-fi elements, factories, heavy industralisation or similarly non-clockwork mechanical elements are not appropriate for Covalon adventures. Mixtures of magic and machine are suitable, however. If you&#x27;re unsure if your setting fits the wider narrative, make sure to ask in a ticket!</p>

<p>##LFGM ((+LFGM))
The LFGM channel is the easiest way to get a ready made batch of players. LFGM posts are organized into individual threads, and you can be made aware of groups that are ready for a dungeon guide by selecting the LFGM tag in #role-selection.</p>
<p>You can browse through the LFGM threads to find a group whose APL matches your dungeon and whose schedule matches your own, and notify them in the thread that you will run their adventure, at which point they will mark it closed.</p>
<p>##Scheduled Events ((+Scheduled Events))
If you do not find a group in LFGM, or would rather not use LFGM, you may instead simply post your adventure directly to #📅scheduled-events. When you do so, you should indicate to players that they should get in touch with you via PM to send you their character details, including their token art and JSON, or other relevant means to import their character sheet to your table.</p>
<p>You do not have to take players first-come, first-serve. You can add them to a pool instead, and select the players you think are most appropriate for your dungeon.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>##Post your Adventure ((+Post Your Adventure))
Once you have decided how you want to gather players, post your adventure in #📅scheduled-events. Your post should include the tier of adventure, what type of adventure it is, the date and time you intend to run the adventure, and the adventure hook. If the group was formed via LFGM, you should put player names and levels here as well in a numbered list; Otherwise, fill the list out with applicants that get in contact with you, or add the players who apply to a pool and select them later.</p>
<p>rules (
#Waitlist
LFGM games may have a waitlist in them, or you may get more applicants than you have slots in your game. When this happens, the extra players go on a waitlist. This waitlist is used if the primary selected players cannot make it for any reason, and waitlisters are used to fill gaps.

<p>You will need to install the Covalon Mentor Module in order to use Mentors in your game.</p>

You have spent time finely tuning your encounters, scouring over loot, gathered your players and its finally time for your session! Here are some key tips to help make your session a successful and safe environment for both you and your players.</p>
<p>##Setting Ground Rules ((+Setting Ground Rules))
It is recommended that at the beginning of your session you set some ground rules for how you like to run your table in terms of player participation. Playing over Discord can be much harder than playing over a tabletop, especially when playing games with people you don&#x27;t know well yet.</p>
<p>You should determine a set of boundaries and expectations for players at the start of your session. This can include things such as trying not to talk over each other, how you will settle rules disputes, when players should (and should not!) offer feedback and any other areas you think are important for your players to be aware of so they have a fun time at the table.</p>
<p>##Managing Disruptions ((+Managing Disruptions))
We are fortunate that Covalon is generally a positive and welcoming space for everyone. We invite others to sit in and watch sessions being run on the server to help people get a sense for the culture of the server. As Covalon is a public server however, this means anyone can join and enter the voice channels while you are running a game session.</p>
<p>The expectation is that anyone not actively participating in your game session mutes themselves and watches silently, utilising text chat channels for interaction relating to the game and freeing up the voice channel for players and yourself.</p>
<p>In the event that a player or audience member is actively disruptive and detrimental to the play experience of your session, all Dungeon Guides are able to mute people in voice channels. If you do this, please create a ticket after your game to let the moderator team know so it can be addressed. In the unlikely event of ongoing or serious disruption to your table, please ping the moderators or admins for additional assistance!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="adjudicating-rules-adjudicating-rules">Adjudicating Rules ((+Adjudicating Rules))<a href="#adjudicating-rules-adjudicating-rules" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Adjudicating Rules ((+Adjudicating Rules))" title="Direct link to Adjudicating Rules ((+Adjudicating Rules))">​</a></h2>
<p>Pathfinder Second Edition is a complex game with a lot of rules, and we try to stick to RAW interpretations as much as possible. Sometimes however, there are some rules that you will need to make a decision on during a session, or you may have forgotten how a particular interaction works and it would be disruptive to the flow of the session to spend a significant amount of time looking it up.</p>
<p>In such cases you should make a table ruling for that session, and endeavour to look up the correct rule after the session. You can do so in any of the appropriate text channels (🧮munchkins-and-mathfinder or 🐣newbie-help-and-discussion are a great place to start) or via creating a ticket to ask the staff team.</p>

#Areas of Effect
Sometimes dying player characters will find themselves in the area of a damaging effect that is focused on another party member. While it is discouraged to specifically avoid hitting an active combat participant in order to hit a dying player character, AoEs are dangerous and they will still sometimes hit a dying character!
)
Pathfinder Second Edition is a tightly balanced system, and players will often find their character in the dying state in combat. For Covalon adventures, you are generally discouraged from attacking players with the dying condition, unless it makes clear tactical sense for the monster to do so.</p>
<p>Actively trying to kill player characters is against the ethos of Covalon, but that doesn&#x27;t mean to say that character death will never happen.</p>
<p>The hallmark of a well-balanced encounter is one that is high in tension and the party barely makes it out alive. Sometimes though, characters don&#x27;t make it out due to bad luck with the dice, poor tactical decisions, or a combination of both. In the event that a player character does die, give the player the space to act out any final moments if they wish. <strong>After the session is concluded, please ping the @Servants Of Terra role. They handle the enacting of contracts and roleplay associated with character deaths.</strong></p>

<p>Items must be distributed according to the following procedure:</p>
<p>1: At the conclusion of the adventure, all players go to the #🧮dice-channel and roll 1d100.
2: The GM notes each result, then posts the loot table in #💰loot-chat.
3: Players, in order of highest D100 roll to lowest, claim items by typing !claim [item name].</p>
<p>Players can select a maximum of one permanent item.</p>
<p>Any permanent items left over after all players have claimed an item are lost, but consumables may be claimed by player choice or distributed by the GM.</p>

#Lycanthropy
Wereanimal curses can result in a player losing control of their character on the night of a full moon. In the event this takes place, you must create a ticket and add the afflicted player to the ticket. There you can talk with the staff team and player to come up with a fun, safe way for the curse to be resolved!
)
Resolve and track any remaining lingering effects that have been applied to player characters throughout the dungeon. In most cases this will be making a post in 🤢 affliction-tracking and pinging the affected player.</p>
<p>At the end of an adventure, create a thread for each player who has received an untreated affliction from that adventure. Your thread title should follow the following format:</p>
<p>math (
Afflicted Player&#x27;s Name | Name of Affliction | YYYY/MM/DD
)</p>
<p>If the player has not identified their affliction, the name of the affliction can be &quot;unknown disease,&quot; &quot;unknown curse,&quot; or even just &quot;unknown affliction.&quot;</p>
<p>The first post of the thread should include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of affliction</li>
<li>Affliction stage (if applicable)</li>
<li>Effects of affliction at current stage</li>
<li>Affliction&#x27;s level (be sure to note whether this is a spell level or a non-spell level)</li>
<li>Save DC</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, you should only include information that the player&#x27;s character has uncovered about the affliction, but you can include more information if you wish. When the player makes a save against their affliction, be sure to reply with any information that has changed (normally the affliction stage and its current effects). If a player has their affliction successfully cured, the affliction expires, or the character dies, the GM should archive the thread. If the player character has an affliction that doesn&#x27;t show symptoms until a certain stage, you have two options: make the thread as normal, but don&#x27;t tag the player in it until they need to make their next save, OR make the thread and tag the player in it as normal, but let them know their character doesn&#x27;t know they have an affliction until after their next save.</p>

<p>A summary of your dungeon must be posted in the #📜dungeon-summary channel, with the following format:</p>
<p>info (
Dungeon Name
Month, Day, Year | Average Party Level
<em>Party Member 1 (Class and Level), Party Member 2 (Class and Level), Party Member 3 (Class and Level), Party Member 4 (Class and Level), Party Member 5 (Class and Level), Party Member 6 (Class and Level)</em></p>
<p>Write a brief summary here. It doesn&#x27;t have to be detailed, just a general overview of what happened is fine to help players kickstart conversations in RP. Maximum length should be a single post.
)</p>
<p>Dungeon summaries are mandatory, and are used to help track experience and level for players on the server. You must complete any outstanding dungeon summaries before submitting further adventures for approval.</p>
<p>##Delete Your Post ((+Delete Your Post))</p>
<p>Once everything else is done, and you have done everything else you need to do, including writing your dungeon summary, the final step is removing your post in #📅scheduled-events. This keeps clutter down and avoids confusing players.</p>
