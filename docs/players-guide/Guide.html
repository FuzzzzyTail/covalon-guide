<p>#What is Covalon?
Covalon is a &quot;living world&quot; style tabletop RPG campaign, using the Pathfinder 2e system, with a focus on providing drop-in/drop-out style adventures and role play in a post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. Our unique campaign weaves a cohesive and open narrative from the backstory and role play contributions of the players with a focus on slow and relaxed progression, giving everyone a chance to enjoy the campaign and develop their chaorracter at their own pace. Individual adventures are jam-packed with combat and intrigue without affecting an overarching plot, which allows characters to have engaging experiences without needing to worry atrbout missing out on a grander narrative. Whether you choose to play with us daily or once a week, Covalon offers fulfilling gameplay for everyone! To make this cohesive setting work, we have some special rules that you may find different from normal campaigns. In general, we try to stick to rules-as-written (RAW) as much as possible, in order to ensure that scheduled play sessions (universally referred to as &quot;adventures&quot; in Covalon) are run as fairly and consistently as possible between our many Game Masters (universally referred to as &quot;dungeon guides&quot; in Covalon). While we encourage players to invent civilizations and deities to fill out our setting, we place strict limits on homebrewed mechanical features, such as items and class features, and we do not use certain optional rules such as voluntary flaws, free archetypes, and dual classing. There are, of course, some exceptions to these rules, which can be found in this ever-updating document. <a href="https://discord.gg/covalon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to join Covalon!</a></p>

<h1>Chapter 1: Player Expectations ((Player Expectations))</h1>
<p>This section covers the behavior expectations players agree to uphold while participating in Covalon, as well as a guide for getting started in the campaign.</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>All players are expected to follow the expectations and guidelines outlined on this page. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary consequences, such as being temporarily muted, prohibited from joining adventures, or being banned from the campaign.</p>
<p>/</p>
<h1>Community Guidelines ((+Community Guidelines))</h1>
<p>The purpose of this community is to have a place where everyone is welcome, and can have fun playing Pathfinder together. With this in mind, we have these guidelines to make sure everyone enjoys their experience in Covalon.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-player-age">1. Player Age<a href="#1-player-age" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Player Age" title="Direct link to 1. Player Age">​</a></h2>
<p>All players must be 18 years of age or older. In addition to this, all characters must be of adult age for their species in order to prevent uncomfortable role playing situations.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-be-civil">2. Be Civil<a href="#2-be-civil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Be Civil" title="Direct link to 2. Be Civil">​</a></h2>
<p>This is a diverse community of many countries, cultures, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, and beliefs. Disrespectful talk of any kind will not be tolerated.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-prohibited-themes">3. Prohibited Themes<a href="#3-prohibited-themes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Prohibited Themes" title="Direct link to 3. Prohibited Themes">​</a></h2>
<p>Although the minimum age requirement to join the server is 18, all out of character conversations and role playing themes must be kept appropriate for a PG-13 rating. Additionally, the following topics and themes are not permitted to be discussed or role played on the server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slavery</li>
<li>Racism</li>
<li>Sexual Abuse</li>
<li>Real-World Politics</li>
<li>Obscene Content</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, please limit discussion of your personal difficulties within Covalon. We are a supportive community, but the primary goal of the server is to roll dice and have fun.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-respect-other-users">4. Respect Other Users<a href="#4-respect-other-users" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Respect Other Users" title="Direct link to 4. Respect Other Users">​</a></h2>
<p>Do not threaten or harass other users. This includes &quot;doxxing,&quot; or revealing any private information about a player without their consent. It also includes pressuring another player to sell, give away, or donate items they receive from an adventure. Do not engage in unsolicited or unwanted sexual advances or conversations of a personal sexual nature. These types of conversations should be limited to Discord direct messaging, and only after receiving the explicit consent of all involved users.

#Managing Conflicts between players
Despite our best efforts, sometimes we come into conflict with others. You can find guidance on how Covalon manages conflicts between players in [this guide.] (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_qpEsvT58OKODNMlMV5kV43A9LB8gNUUaLYXaOJm9_g/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_qpEsvT58OKODNMlMV5kV43A9LB8gNUUaLYXaOJm9_g/edit?usp=sharing</a>)<br>

<p>Covalon does not allow players to have multiple Discord accounts within the server.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-self-promotion">6. Self-Promotion<a href="#6-self-promotion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6. Self-Promotion" title="Direct link to 6. Self-Promotion">​</a></h2>
<p>Self-promotion should be kept to a reasonable limit, and should use the proper channels. For example, if you want to advertise your artistic talents, use the #artwork channel.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7-questions-and-concerns">7. Questions and Concerns<a href="#7-questions-and-concerns" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 7. Questions and Concerns" title="Direct link to 7. Questions and Concerns">​</a></h2>
<p>All suggestions for the server or sensitive concerns should be brought to the private attention of the Administrator and Moderator teams via the ticket system, which can be accessed via the #create-a-ticket channel in the Discord server.</p>
<p>note(</p>
<h1>Community Safety</h1>
<p>We take the safety of our community very seriously. If at any point, you feel harassed, threatened, or uncomfortable, please #create-a-ticket. The Administrators and Moderators will investigate the situation and take action appropriately.
)</p>
<p>=</p>
<h1>Roleplay Guidelines ((+Roleplay Guidelines))</h1>
<p>These guidelines should be observed during role playing, whether in an adventure or in the Discord text channels.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-avoid-powergaming">1. Avoid Powergaming<a href="#1-avoid-powergaming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Avoid Powergaming" title="Direct link to 1. Avoid Powergaming">​</a></h2>
<p>Do not narrate what another character says or does. Player actions are to be decided by the players themselves. This is a collaborative storytelling setting, please don&#x27;t force someone to change their character or story to suit your needs.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-depiction-of-adult-themes">2. Depiction of Adult Themes<a href="#2-depiction-of-adult-themes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Depiction of Adult Themes" title="Direct link to 2. Depiction of Adult Themes">​</a></h2>
<p>Do not be excessively violent or sexually explicit. Conversation topics and roleplay themes should be kept appropriate for a PG-13 rating.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-one-character-per-player">3. One Character per Player<a href="#3-one-character-per-player" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. One Character per Player" title="Direct link to 3. One Character per Player">​</a></h2>
<p>Your player character must be the character you use for roleplay; you cannot roleplay as NPCs. You may roleplay as your familiar, eidolon, or companion, but you may only actively roleplay in a single roleplay channel at a time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-dice-rolls">4. Dice Rolls<a href="#4-dice-rolls" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Dice Rolls" title="Direct link to 4. Dice Rolls">​</a></h2>
<p>Please restrict dice rolling in text channels to their designated channels.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-coercion-and-pressure">5. Coercion and Pressure<a href="#5-coercion-and-pressure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Coercion and Pressure" title="Direct link to 5. Coercion and Pressure">​</a></h2>
<p>While charity and acts of kindness are encouraged in Covalon, please do not pressure or coerce other players into providing assistance that they have not offered.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-player-vs-player">6. Player Vs. Player<a href="#6-player-vs-player" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6. Player Vs. Player" title="Direct link to 6. Player Vs. Player">​</a></h2>
<p>Any player vs. player (PvP) conflicts that require rolling dice must have explicit OOC consent of both parties before commencing. If you are expecting role play with another player that involves conflict, please ensure you obtain their consent first. Once you have both agreed, please #create-a-ticket (adding all involved players) to inform the Moderator team of the expected narrative and outcome.</p>
<p>|</p>
<h1>Gameplay Guidelines ((+Gameplay Guidelines))</h1>
<p>These guidelines should be observed during adventures, though some of them also apply to gameplay outside of adventures.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-plan-your-turns">1. Plan Your Turns<a href="#1-plan-your-turns" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Plan Your Turns" title="Direct link to 1. Plan Your Turns">​</a></h2>
<p>During encounter mode, try to prepare your actions before your turn to ensure you are being courteous of everyone&#x27;s time.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-share-the-spotlight">2. Share the Spotlight<a href="#2-share-the-spotlight" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Share the Spotlight" title="Direct link to 2. Share the Spotlight">​</a></h2>
<p>Give other players an opportunity to participate equally; try not to dominate an adventure by speaking or acting more than others.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-bookkeeping">3. Bookkeeping<a href="#3-bookkeeping" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Bookkeeping" title="Direct link to 3. Bookkeeping">​</a></h2>

<p>Do not try to &quot;metagame&quot; or exploit the game system for mechanical advantage. This includes accessing out-of-character (OOC) information to make decisions in-character (IC), such as looking up the abilities and statistics of creatures on Archives of Nethys while in the middle of a game.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-character-deaths">5. Character Deaths<a href="#5-character-deaths" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Character Deaths" title="Direct link to 5. Character Deaths">​</a></h2>
<p>Character deaths in Covalon are permanent. If your character dies, you will need to create a new one to continue playing. If you wish to insure your character against death, you can purchase a Contract of Terran Revival for your character, which will give them protection against the next time they would die.</p>

<h1>First Steps into Covalon</h1>
<p>Need some ideas for where to start role playing? Here are some suggestions!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="covalon-walls-and-gate">Covalon Walls and Gate<a href="#covalon-walls-and-gate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Covalon Walls and Gate" title="Direct link to Covalon Walls and Gate">​</a></h2>
<p>Most new players like to role play their character&#x27;s first entrance into Covalon. A good place to start is the #covalon-walls-and-gate. A player character may let you into the city, but if no one is available, you may describe your entrance into Covalon as you wish.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="heartstone-sanctuary">Heartstone Sanctuary<a href="#heartstone-sanctuary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Heartstone Sanctuary" title="Direct link to Heartstone Sanctuary">​</a></h2>
<p>The #heartstone-sanctuary has boarding, food, and baths for all players who can not yet afford a house. You are welcome to stay there at no cost until another option becomes available.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="docs-medical-center">Doc&#x27;s Medical Center<a href="#docs-medical-center" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Doc&#x27;s Medical Center" title="Direct link to Doc&#x27;s Medical Center">​</a></h2>
<p>Going to the #infirmary-ground-floor is a good beginning activity. Your character can receive a medical exam and have a patient file created by one of the hospital staff.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-brass-snail-tavern">The Brass Snail Tavern<a href="#the-brass-snail-tavern" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Brass Snail Tavern" title="Direct link to The Brass Snail Tavern">​</a></h2>
<p>The #brass-snail-tavern offers a free meal for newcomers, and is a common social gathering place. Entering the Snail is a great way to signal to other players that you&#x27;d like to role play.

<h1>Joining Adventures</h1>
<p>There are two primary methods for singing up to play in adventures in Covalon.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scheduled-events">Scheduled Events<a href="#scheduled-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scheduled Events" title="Direct link to Scheduled Events">​</a></h2>
<p>Upcoming adventures are posted in the #scheduled-events channel. When a Dungeon Guide has an adventure to run, they&#x27;ll make a post in this channel with sign-up instructions and players of the appropriate level will be notified. If an adventure&#x27;s roster is full, players can still join a waitlist in case there&#x27;s a vacancy.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lfgm">LFGM<a href="#lfgm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LFGM" title="Direct link to LFGM">​</a></h2>
<p>Players can form pre-made parties in the #lfgm channel and then request a Dungeon Guide to run a certain type of adventure for the party at a particular time. Check the pinned post in the #lfgm channel for specific instructions on how to use it.</p>

<p>)</p>
<p>Before you can participate in Covalon, you need to create a character. If you don&#x27;t own the Pathfinder 2e source books or you&#x27;re new to the game, you can find all rules and character options at the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/PlayersGuide.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Archives of Nethys</a> website. Each player may only have one active character at a time, so create a character that you&#x27;ll love to play!</p>
<h1>Character Creation Rules ((+Character Creation Rules))</h1>
<p>For the most part, Covalon uses the same character creation rules as the default character creation rules in the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core Rulebook (CRB), but there are some key differences.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alternative-ability-boosts-alternative-ability-boosts">Alternative Ability Boosts ((++Alternative Ability Boosts))<a href="#alternative-ability-boosts-alternative-ability-boosts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternative Ability Boosts ((++Alternative Ability Boosts))" title="Direct link to Alternative Ability Boosts ((++Alternative Ability Boosts))">​</a></h2>
<p>Alternative ability boosts were added during the 4th printing Core Rulebook errata as an option to take two free ability boosts instead of your ancestry&#x27;s listed ability boosts and flaws. This option is available to all characters.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="voluntary-flaws-voluntary-flaws">Voluntary Flaws ((++Voluntary Flaws))<a href="#voluntary-flaws-voluntary-flaws" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Voluntary Flaws ((++Voluntary Flaws))" title="Direct link to Voluntary Flaws ((++Voluntary Flaws))">​</a></h2>
<p>Voluntary Flaws - the optional rule to take additional ability flaws - are not allowed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="variant-rules-variant-rules">Variant Rules ((++Variant Rules))<a href="#variant-rules-variant-rules" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Variant Rules ((++Variant Rules))" title="Direct link to Variant Rules ((++Variant Rules))">​</a></h2>
<p>Covalon does not use any of the Variant Rules systems from the Gamemastery Guide (GMG). This includes Free Archetype, Dual-Class PCs, Ancestry Paragon, Proficiency without Level, etc.</p>
<p>/</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="character-option-rarity-character-option-rarity">Character Option Rarity ((++Character Option Rarity))<a href="#character-option-rarity-character-option-rarity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Character Option Rarity ((++Character Option Rarity))" title="Direct link to Character Option Rarity ((++Character Option Rarity))">​</a></h2>
<p>By default, all common character options, including ancestries, backgrounds, classes, feats and equipment, are allowed in Covalon. Conversely, all uncommon and rarer character options are disallowed by default in Covalon, but many exceptions can be found in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yUXF_IAmpim6wkB7QT5l6K_lS5DgOppv99BHjMYbNIU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Allowlist</a> document.

<p>Your character&#x27;s starting 15 gp may be used to purchase equipment from the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common level 0 items</li>
<li>Uncommon level 0 classic firearms</li>
<li>Uncommon level 0 items that your character has access to via a feat (such as Elven Weapon Familiarity or Monastic Weaponry)</li>
</ul>
<p>|</p>
<p>note (</p>
<h1>Access to Uncommon Options</h1>
<p>Covalon has special rules for accessing uncommon options during character creation, which are different from accessing uncommon options <em>after</em> character creation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="region-based-access">Region-Based Access<a href="#region-based-access" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Region-Based Access" title="Direct link to Region-Based Access">​</a></h2>
<p>Some uncommon character options, such as backgrounds and archetypes, are only accessible to characters from certain regions of the world. Covalon exists in a separate world from Golarion so many of these access entries do not apply - check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yUXF_IAmpim6wkB7QT5l6K_lS5DgOppv99BHjMYbNIU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Allowlist</a> to confirm for each option.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="classic-firearms">Classic Firearms<a href="#classic-firearms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Classic Firearms" title="Direct link to Classic Firearms">​</a></h2>
<p>All characters have access to classic firearms. This includes most non-magical firearms but notably excludes beast guns, cobbled weapons, and combination weapons.</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>Please note that the starting equipment your character has access to may be different from what is purchasable from the General Store in Covalon <em>after</em> character creation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="character-backstory-character-backstory">Character Backstory ((++Character Backstory))<a href="#character-backstory-character-backstory" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Character Backstory ((++Character Backstory))" title="Direct link to Character Backstory ((++Character Backstory))">​</a></h2>
<p>You&#x27;ll need to create a backstory for your character that describes who they are and what their life was like prior to joining Covalon. In order to create a character backstory that is cohesive with the campaign&#x27;s world, please reference the Campaign Lore section of this guide. The key questions you&#x27;ll want to answer for your character&#x27;s backstory are:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What was my character&#x27;s life like before the Cataclysm?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;How did the Cataclysm affect my character?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What&#x27;s my character&#x27;s motivation for continuing to survive?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, your character must be an immigrant to Covalon and they may not have any NPCs or backstory characters accompany them.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#x27;re ready to submit your character to the Administrators and Moderators for approval, go to the #create-a-ticket channel in the Discord server and create a ticket, then post a link to your digital character sheet. If you need help building your character, feel free to ask questions in the #newbie-help-and-discussion channel.</p>

<h1>Web and App-Based Character Sheets ((+Web and App-Based Character Sheets))</h1>
<p>Covalon recommends two different character sheet applications for building and updating your character between adventures: Pathbuilder 2e and Wanderer&#x27;s Guide.</p>
<p>/</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pathbuilder-2e-pathbuilder-2e">Pathbuilder 2e ((++Pathbuilder 2e))<a href="#pathbuilder-2e-pathbuilder-2e" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pathbuilder 2e ((++Pathbuilder 2e))" title="Direct link to Pathbuilder 2e ((++Pathbuilder 2e))">​</a></h2>
<p>Covalon staff prefer that players use <a href="https://pathbuilder2e.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pathbuilder 2e</a> to build and update their characters. It is available as both a <a href="https://pathbuilder2e.com/app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web-based application</a> and as an Android app in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redrazors.pathbuilder2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a>. It&#x27;s free to use most of the app, but certain premium features (such as animal companion and familiar management) must be unlocked by making a one-time $5 premium license purchase. Be sure to disable any third-party options when building your character; Covalon only plays with character options published by Paizo.</p>
<p>|</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wanderers-guide-wanderers-guide">Wanderer&#x27;s Guide ((++Wanderer&#x27;s Guide))<a href="#wanderers-guide-wanderers-guide" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wanderer&#x27;s Guide ((++Wanderer&#x27;s Guide))" title="Direct link to Wanderer&#x27;s Guide ((++Wanderer&#x27;s Guide))">​</a></h2>
<p>As an alternative to Pathbuilder 2e, <a href="https://wanderersguide.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wanderer&#x27;s Guide</a> is also a free web-based app for player character management. It allows players to manage their animal companions and familiars without a premium license, but it does not have the ability to import directly into the Foundry Virtual Tabletop software, requiring manual data entry on either the Dungeon Guide or player&#x27;s part. If you use Wanderer&#x27;s Guide to create your character, be sure to check that your character is publicly viewable in the app&#x27;s basic settings.</p>
<p>/</p>
<h1>Requesting New Character Options ((+Requesting New Character Options))</h1>
<p>If you&#x27;d like to utilize a character option that isn&#x27;t listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yUXF_IAmpim6wkB7QT5l6K_lS5DgOppv99BHjMYbNIU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Allowlist</a>, you can #create-a-ticket to request the Administrators to review it during their next meeting. Character options from new Paizo book releases are not automatically flagged for review; they must be submitted for review by a player via a ticket.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>note(
#Reflavoring Character Options
In order to maintain a fair gaming environment for all players, Covalon restricts the use of reflavoring equipment, abilities, and other character options. For example, a longsword cannot be reflavored as a shovel or a machete, it must be a longsword. A snake familiar cannot be reflavored as a tiny dragon or a hydra, it must be a snake.
)</p>
<p>/</p>
<h1>Rebuilding Your Character ((+Rebuilding Your Character))</h1>
<p>If you&#x27;re unhappy with your character, you may rebuild any or all aspects of that character instantly and with no cost as long as your character is level 3 or lower. The exception to this rule is starting equipment - you can only swap out your starting equipment if you are level 1 with 0 XP. Characters that ascend past level 3 but later have their level reduced (due to a failed Terran Reincarnation or reviving at a lower level due to a low level Contract of Terran Revival) are not eligible for free rebuilds, and must retrain or have the ritual of Terran Reincarnation performed on them instead. You must #create-a-ticket to have your rebuild approved by a Moderator.</p>
<p>/</p>
<h1>Retiring Your Character ((+Retiring Your Character))</h1>
<p>If you aren&#x27;t enjoying playing your character or if you just want to start over with a new one, you can voluntarily retire your current character. A retired character must forfeit all of their equipment, currency, and titles - these cannot be donated to another character before retirement. If the character owns private property, a business, or a guild hall, the property may be transferred to another tenant, employee, or guild member respectively, otherwise the property is forfeit as well. Once a character has been retired, they can never be played again.</p>

<h1>Planning for Retirement</h1>
<p>Retiring a character is a decision that shouldn&#x27;t be made lightly. Here are some things to consider before deciding to retire your character.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="terran-reincarnation">Terran Reincarnation<a href="#terran-reincarnation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Terran Reincarnation" title="Direct link to Terran Reincarnation">​</a></h2>
<p>You can undergo a ritual of Terran Reincarnation to change almost any aspect of your character without needing to start over. This is a great option if you want to try out a different ancestry or class without losing your character&#x27;s identity or equipment, or if you want to lower your character&#x27;s level with no other changes.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-go-out-with-a-bang">Don&#x27;t Go Out with a Bang<a href="#dont-go-out-with-a-bang" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Don&#x27;t Go Out with a Bang" title="Direct link to Don&#x27;t Go Out with a Bang">​</a></h2>
<p>Covalon - the last civilization in the world - only thrives because of its citizens&#x27; commitment to cooperating and surviving together. Thus, a flashy retirement narrative is inappropriate for our setting. Roleplaying a character&#x27;s decision to retire should be quiet and subtle, such as giving up adventuring to live a simple farmer&#x27;s life, or silently absconding from the city in the dead of night.

<p>Covalon has been designed with a focus on slow, gradual progression that&#x27;s jam-packed with activities along the way.

<p>If your character relies heavily on abilities with a limited number of usages per rest (such as spells or infused reagents), you may want to think carefully about participating in multiple adventures in the same day - your character won&#x27;t recharge these abilities in between!

<p>Most of the stores ran by NPCs in Covalon are little more than market stalls selling food and mundane goods, but there are two establishments that are of interest to adventurers - the General Store and Crafting Hall. From these stores, players are able to purchase the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common level 0 mundane equipment</li>
<li>All Uncommon level 0 classic firearms</li>
<li>Uncommon level 0 weapons for which Covalon has the formula listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WpVq0OUl0jGqQNaYonDDJEmdGMiRynHVLnqjGmkTg4c/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crafting Hall.</a></li>
<li>Common formulas for items with levels less than or equal to the settlement&#x27;s level</li>
</ul>
<p>All other items must be found as loot during adventures, traded between players, or crafted by players. Players cannot sell equipment to NPC stores, but they can sell crafting reagents for half their value. For more information on obtaining equipment, see the Crafting section in this guide.</p>

<p>During adventures, items with the infused trait - as well as temporary items created during daily preparations that last until a character&#x27;s next daily preparations (such as talismans created by the Talisman Dabbler archetype&#x27;s abilities) - cease to function if the creator(s) of the item(s) is not in the adventuring party.</p>

<p>In order to preserve gameplay balance, Covalon uses special rules when characters use items that are a higher level than they are. Under most circumstances, characters cannot use equipment with a level in a tier higher than that player&#x27;s tier, and these items lose their effects while in an adventure. Exceptions to this rule include items with different forms at different levels (healing potions, staves, skill action tools, etc.), magic weapons, armor, and shields, and equipment made with precious materials.</p>
<p>If the item has different forms at different levels, for the course of an adventure, the item will revert to the highest level form that is tier legal for the owning character. For example, if you are a level 2 character and bring a Healing Potion (Moderate) into an adventure, that item would revert to a Healing Potion (Lesser) for the duration of that adventure.</p>
<p>If the item is a magic weapon, armor, or shield, any runes it contains that belong to a tier higher than the character&#x27;s tier will be disabled, or they will revert to the highest level form that is tier legal for that character if such forms exist. For example, if you are a level 2 character and bring a +2 striking flaming shortsword into an adventure, that item would revert to a +1 shortsword for the duration of that adventure. If the item is a specific magic weapon, armor, or shield, the item&#x27;s special properties are disabled. For example, if you are a level 2 character and bring a Caterwaul Sling into an adventure, that item would revert to a +1 sling for the duration of the adventure.</p>
<p>If the equipment is made with precious materials, the effects of those precious materials will be suspended, or they will revert to a lower quality version of that precious material if such a version exists. For example, if you are a level 5 character and bring a standard-grade cold iron longsword into an adventure, then that item would revert to a low-grade cold iron longsword for the duration of that adventure.</p>

<p>Covalon&#x27;s mentor system allows for higher-level players to borrow pre-made characters in order to play with lower-level players. Mentor characters can be played in Tier 3 and under games, and can be played by players whose character is in a higher tier than the adventure. (For example, a player with a Tier 3 character could play as a mentor in Tier 1 and 2 games.) When a qualifying patrol or dungeon is posted in #scheduled-events, a qualifying player may sign up by sending a direct message to the hosting Dungeon Guide and letting them know that they would like to play as a mentor. Mentor players are always added to the waitlist; player characters of the appropriate tier are given priority for table slots.</p>
<p>There are currently sixteen mentors available, one for each class in the Core Rulebook and Advanced Player&#x27;s Guide. A mentor player can choose which class they&#x27;d like to play in advance, or they can browse the available mentors and select one once the GM opens their Foundry server for mustering. When you play a mentor character, you do not earn any XP, but any gp or items you obtain are transferred to your player character. You also receive 1 Hero Point for your player character (see the Hero Point sidebar in the Adventures section).</p>

#Covalon&#x27;s Mentors
The characters that make up Covalon&#x27;s mentorship program are retired adventurers who have already lived full lives, but have been called to serve the city as wizened guides for green adventurers. The mentors were all designed by players as part of a &quot;Design a Mentor&quot; contest, where over 50 characters were submitted to become Covalon&#x27;s official mentor characters!</p>

<p>The world outside of Covalon is a dangerous place, and it&#x27;s not uncommon for adventurers to contract dangerous diseases and curses during their escapades. Afflictions progress in real time, and must be handled at their regular intervals. If your character receives an affliction that is untreated by the end of the adventure, it doesn&#x27;t go away on its own - they&#x27;ll have to overcome it or find someone to cure it if they want to avoid its adverse effects. For more information on how tracking afflictions works in Covalon, see the pinnned post in the #affliction-tracking channel in the Discord server.</p>

<p>Covalon boasts an impressive library that grows larger as adventurers recover historic and legendary spellbooks from their adventures. Players can use the library to learn new spells, including spells that are uncommon or rarer. When using the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn a Spell</a> activity in between adventures, players can choose to learn any common spell with a level less than or equal to half the settlement level rounded up, as well as any uncommon or rarer spell marked as &quot;ALLOWED&quot; or &quot;ERRATA&quot; on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yUXF_IAmpim6wkB7QT5l6K_lS5DgOppv99BHjMYbNIU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Allowlist</a> that meets the same level requirements.

<p>As they&#x27;ve spent more time in the vicinity of the Heart of Terra and its seeds, incredible powers have begun to manifest within the souls of Covalonians. Upon completing their first expedition finale, your character unlocks their Soul Seed - an intangible relic bound to their soul that can be customized with special powers. Players should use the #soul-seed-customization channel in Discord to track changes to their Soul Seed.</p>
<p>Covalon uses the rules for Soul Seeds found in the <em>Gamemastery Guide</em> and <em>Secrets of Magic</em> books, with the following changes. A character&#x27;s physical appearance does not change as a result of their developing Soul Seed. A character does not have access to upgrading of modifying their Soul Seed until they unlock their first aspect category by completing (or GMing) an expedition finale, and they can only choose aspects from categories they unlock by completing expedition finales. A list of aspects and their corresponding gifts can be found in the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Relics.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equipment section of Archives of Nethys</a>. Table 3-2 lists which expedition finales must be completed to unlock a particular aspect category. Soul Seeds are not lost upon character death if the character is brought back to life.</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>Initially, a character&#x27;s Soul Seed can only obtain minor gifts, and their Soul Seed can only be customized with gifts from a single aspect. Completing certain Expedition Finales upgrades their Soul Seed with the ability to use stronger gifts or gifts from a second aspect. Table 3-3 lists which expedition finales must be completed to unlock a particular Soul Seed upgrade.</p>
<p>To add a new gift to a Soul Seed, a character must commune with the Heart of Terra and pay a gold cost. This does not consume downtime, but can only be performed in between adventures. A character also must meet a minimum level requirement, based on the gift they are attempting to add. Table 3-4 lists the cost and minimum level requirement for adding a new gift.</p>
<p>Once a gift has been added to a Soul Seed, it cannot be removed, but it can be changed to a different gift within the aspect via retraining, which takes four days. A character can also retrain one or more of their Soul Seed&#x27;s aspects, which also takes four days. When a Soul Seed&#x27;s aspect is retrained, any incompatible gifts it has are rendered inert until they are retrained. Characters may also use Terran Reincarnation to change their Soul Seed&#x27;s gifts or aspects instead of retraining.</p>
<p>note(</p>
<h1>Gift Specifics</h1>
<p>Gifts that require a weapon as a prerequisite to activate use a weapon you are holding when activating the gift. Ignore any prerequisites that require a worn item. Any gifts that have &quot;Interact&quot; as part of their activation requirement have that replaced with a special somatic component that still has the Manipulate trait. Your Soul Seed&#x27;s level is equal to your own level.</p>

<h1>Server Time</h1>
<p>Events are scheduled according to &quot;server time,&quot; which is Covalon&#x27;s standardized operating time zone. During the winter and spring, it operates on Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8), and during the summer and fall, it uses Pacific Daylight Time (UTC -7).
)</p>
<p>Outside of adjustments to core gameplay, Covalon&#x27;s gameplay systems are broken into three categories. &quot;Adventures&quot; are scheduled play sessions between players and a Dungeon Guide where player characters work together to overcome adversaries, obstacles, and other challenges to receive experience points (XP) and loot. &quot;Downtime&quot; consists of the work your character performs in between adventures to prepare for the next one. &quot;Roleplay&quot; encompasses all of our unique features and mechanics that facilitate player interaction outside of adventures.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Adventures ((+Adventures))</h1>
<p>Adventures are scheduled play sessions that will challenge your character to utilize their abilities, equipment, and teamwork with others in order to gain experience and essential supplies for Covalon.</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>There are several distinct types of adventures in Covalon, each with their own unique flavor of gameplay, challenges, and rewards. Most adventures award 250 XP and a level-appropriate amount of treasure, with low level characters receiving an increased amount of both to help them catch up. Patrols and brawls for Tier 1 and 2 grant 500 XP and double treasure while dungeons grant 1000 XP and four times the treasure.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>note (</p>
<h1>Communicate Your Level!</h1>
<p>When signing up for an adventure, be sure to tell the Dungeon Guide the level you expect your character to be when the adventure occurs. If you have other adventures in between, your character may level up before the adventure occurs. Be sure to let your Dungeon Guide know about this as soon as possible so they can appropriately adjust their adventure.

<p>The premiere adventure type in Covalon is the dungeon. This adventure type involves going through a portal to a random location in the world in order to salvage supplies or recover lost treasures, and while they always involve a degree of exploration, they don&#x27;t always take place in literal dungeons. These adventures typically last three to four hours long and include multiple combat encounters as well as puzzles, skill challenges, and roleplay opportunities. They typically award all types of treasure.</p>
<p>Dungeon operations are overseen by the portal specialists of the Dungeoneering Society, who ensure that any recovered treasure is distributed fairly. At the end of a dungeon, all players roll 1d100 in the #dice-channel to determine a loot priority order. The player who rolled the highest gets to pick an item from the dungeon&#x27;s treasure first, followed by the player who rolled the second highest, and so on and so forth - if there is loot leftover after the last player in the order selects an item, the order repeats from the top. There is no limit to the number of consumables players can receive from dungeons, but a player can claim a maximum of <strong>1</strong> non-consumable piece of equipment from a dungeon (excluding formulas, which are given to the players to donate to the Crafting Hall). Anything not claimed by a player is donated to the Dungeoneering Society to finance further dungeon operations.</p>

<p>As the last bastion of civilization, Covalon faces minor threats on a daily basis. Patrols deal with handling these minor threats, and are intended to help lower-level characters level up quickly. These adventures typically last an hour and include a single combat encounter. They generally don&#x27;t feature any exploration or puzzles and contain minimal roleplay opportunities, and only award gold and consumables as treasure. Patrols are currently available to Tier 1, 2 and 3 players.</p>

<h1>Hero Points</h1>
<p>Unlike a traditional campaign, not all Hero Points granted in Covalon expire at the end of a session; some stay with you until they are used.</p>

<p>Player characters can practice combat strategies against each other while entertaining the other citizens of Covalon by participating in friendly brawls - a PvP adventure type where two teams of three duke it out against one another in the arena. Brawls usually last around one or two hours, though they can run as long as four hours if a winning team is not decided sooner. Brawls consist of a single combat encounter, and player characters cannot die during brawls - if they would die, they receive healing from the arena medics and then rejoin the fight! Both teams receive gold and XP for participating. At the beginning of each brawl, an objective is determined by the presiding Dungeon Guide, which greatly influences the tactics teams will need to use in order to win. Only Senior Dungeon Guides may run brawls, and brawls can only be scheduled by pre-formed teams using the #lfgm channel.</p>

<h1>Becoming the Battlemaster</h1>
<p>At the conclusion of a brawl, each member of the winning team is awarded a Gladiator Token to represent their victory in the arena. Gladiator Tokens hold no value on their own, but symbolize a degree of martial prowess that&#x27;s respected by Covalon&#x27;s ruling council. Upon reaching certain Gladiator Token milestones, players can #create-a-ticket to earn a presitigious title for their character.</p>

<p>A flag appears at the center of the arena. A player with a free hand can use an Interact action to grab the flag, which is considered light bulk.

After a flag is Scored, it immediately returns to the middle of the battlefield. The first team to reach 3 points wins. If a team is eliminated, the surviving team wins.</p>
<p>rules (</p>
<h1>Advanced Brawl Rules ((+++Advanced Brawl Rules))</h1>
<ul>
<li>A &quot;respawn&quot; is triggered when a player&#x27;s turn begins while they are unconscious with 0 hit points. They are immediately teleported back to their team&#x27;s starting area, fully healed, and have all non-permanent effects removed from them (excluding afflictions acquired prior to the brawl). Their turn then ends, and if the game mode is deathmatch, the opposing team gains 1 point. (Any items they dropped as a result of being knocked unconscious remain in the original square that player was knocked unconscious in.)</li>
<li>For control points, an &quot;end of round&quot; token is added to initiative. Scoring is calculated when the end of round token&#x27;s turn comes up. Any player who attempts to delay their turn to go just before the end of round token will instead be placed just after it.</li>
<li>Hero Points cannot be used in brawls, players do not receive a temporary Hero Point for participating in a brawl, and players cannot earn Hero Points from participating in a brawl.</li>
<li>When entering a brawl, players are stripped of all beneficial effects currently affecting them except for effects that last &quot;until your next daily preparations.&quot; Negative effects from any source (such as conditions, afflictions, or an Oracular curse) are not stripped when entering a Brawl. Hunt Prey, Pursue a Lead, and other similar abilities cannot be used before a Brawl.</li>
<li>The invisible condition makes a character hidden to everyone instead of undetected during a brawl. No players may become undetected or unobserved during a brawl.</li>
<li>The presiding GM may elect to enforce a two-minute turn time limit for players during a brawl if players are taking excessively long turns.</li>

<p>Players who seek a challenge more difficult than standard adventures need look no further than descents, which are the most dangerous but also the most lucrative of adventure types offered in Covalon. They are similar to dungeons, but feature increased encounter difficulty and challenging modifiers that vary depending on the location in which the descent takes place. These adventures last up to four hours long and reward increased treasure compared to normal adventures, but are only open to the highest tier of players (and it is recommended that only max level players attempt them). Only Senior Dungeon Guides may run descents, and descents can only be scheduled by pre-formed teams using the #lfgm channel. Additionally, the location in which the descent takes place influences some of the rules of the descent.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-maw-the-maw">The Maw ((+++The Maw))<a href="#the-maw-the-maw" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Maw ((+++The Maw))" title="Direct link to The Maw ((+++The Maw))">​</a></h3>
<p>In the wastelands south of Covalon lurks the Maw - a living chasm of destructive power born in the wake of the Cataclysm. Missions into the Maw are necessary in order to obtain Maw Stones, which hold secrets that may link to the cause of the Cataclysm as well as a method to defeat the Maw itself. Descents into the Maw consist of a gauntlet where players attempt to defeat up to four combat encounters. The difficulty of the first encounter will be of moderate difficulty while the other encounters are of severe difficulty. Additionally, creatures that are typically considered too powerful for other adventure types may appear during descents into the Maw. As a courtesy to our players, if the descent reaches its fourth hour of play, no more encounters can be attempted after the current one finishes.</p>
<p>Between encounters, players can use 10 minutes of exploration activities, after which they can choose to undertake the next encounter or retreat home with the loot they&#x27;ve received so far. Players cannot retreat during combat encounters, and a player character that dies during a descent into the Maw cannot have their gear recovered by their allies. Players earn gold for each encounter they defeat, with the potential to earn more than that of other adventure types for defeating at least three encounters.</p>

<p>In the vast world of Elleaterra, other locations harboring dangerous power may exist that warrant exploration by the strongest of adventures. Who knows what secrets await discovery, laying buried underneath the destruction wrought by the Cataclysm?</p>
<p>=</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="expeditions-expeditions">Expeditions ((++Expeditions))<a href="#expeditions-expeditions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expeditions ((++Expeditions))" title="Direct link to Expeditions ((++Expeditions))">​</a></h2>
<p>The Cataclysm wrought destruction across the world of Elleaterra, leveling all civilizations to the ground, save Covalon. These old locations are nothing more than ruins now, but those ruins may be worth searching for resources, treasures, and most importantly, answers on how to defeat the Maw once and for all. Expeditions are multi-phase adventures that require players to cooperate together in order to reclaim these fallen societies. Each expedition consists of three phases.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="phase-1-establish-base-camp-phase-1">Phase 1: Establish Base Camp ((+++Phase 1))<a href="#phase-1-establish-base-camp-phase-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 1: Establish Base Camp ((+++Phase 1))" title="Direct link to Phase 1: Establish Base Camp ((+++Phase 1))">​</a></h3>
<p>The first phase of an expedition is to establish a camp at the site of the former civilization to serve as a base of operations for the expedition itself. If the location is difficult to reach, this phase may involve constructing a vehicle to get there, or building a specialized structure in order to survive the unique circumstances of a location. This phase of an expedition does not occur like a normal adventure, but instead functions as a community goal that players must contribute resources to complete. The specific resources that must be contributed vary depending on the expedition location, and the current requirements to establish a base camp for a given expedition can be found in the #expedition-logs channel in the Discord server. Once base camp has been established for a location, this phase concludes and the next phase becomes available.</p>
<p>/</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="phase-2-complete-missions-phase-2">Phase 2: Complete Missions ((+++Phase 2))<a href="#phase-2-complete-missions-phase-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 2: Complete Missions ((+++Phase 2))" title="Direct link to Phase 2: Complete Missions ((+++Phase 2))">​</a></h3>
<p>The second phase of an expedition requires adventurers to complete a variety of missions in order to explore the area, secure the base camp, and uncover clues about the Cataclysm. Missions are a subtype of expedition adventures that are similar to dungeons, but contribute to an overarching narrative, and are available to all tiers. Each expedition features three missions which have distinct objectives and elements. Any individual mission is repeatable, though some content in the mission changes between repeats. Once several missions have been completed for a location, this phase concludes and the next phase becomes available (though the missions can still be played after the phase has concluded).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="phase-3-complete-the-finale-phase-3">Phase 3: Complete the Finale ((+++Phase 3))<a href="#phase-3-complete-the-finale-phase-3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phase 3: Complete the Finale ((+++Phase 3))" title="Direct link to Phase 3: Complete the Finale ((+++Phase 3))">​</a></h3>
<p>Once each expedition has been completed a certain number of times, the expedition finale unlocks. A finale involves a singular encounter against a narratively significant threat to conclude the expedition. Completing a finale unlocks a new way for participants to customize their Soul Seeds, and like missions, they are repeatable. Finales can be attempted by players in Tier 2 or higher and last 1 to 2 hours.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>note(</p>
<h1>Requesting an Expedition Mission</h1>
<p>If there is a particular expedition adventure you&#x27;d like to play in, you can always use #lfgm to create a party and request a Dungeon Guide to run the adventure for you. You can even choose which mission you&#x27;d like to play. Once Phase 2 has been unlocked for an expedition, three missions become available that are always referred to as Mission A, Mission B, and Mission C. Though the missions are all narratively linked, they can be experienced in any order, as they are not prequels or sequels to each other. It may also be worthwhile to select the mission that has been played the least, as all missions must be completed a number of times before the finale unlocks.</p>
<h1>Requesting an Expedition Finale</h1>
<p>Soul Seed aspects must be unlocked by completing specific expedition finales, which you can use #lfgm to organize a party for. Normal mode finales utilize variant modifications to keep repeats interesting, so if you have a friend who needs help attempting a finale that you&#x27;ve already completed, give them a hand and you might see something new. Players with characters in the highest tier can alternatively request hard mode, which employs all variant modifications at once!
)</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>Finales have two difficulty modes. Normal mode is the standard finale experience, which can be scaled to any tier. Hard mode can only be attempted by characters in the highest tier, and is intended for max level characters. When a finale first becomes available, it can only be attempted at hard mode. Once a finale has been cleared once, normal mode becomes available</p>

<h1>Downtime ((+Downtime))</h1>
<p>Downtime is an important part of how your character spends their time in between adventures in Covalon. Your character can spend downtime to earn income, craft items, retrain their abilities, and perform other special activities to improve themselves and get ready for future adventures.</p>
<p>/</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="earning-and-spending-downtime-earning-and-spending-downtime">Earning and Spending Downtime ((++Earning and Spending Downtime))<a href="#earning-and-spending-downtime-earning-and-spending-downtime" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Earning and Spending Downtime ((++Earning and Spending Downtime))" title="Direct link to Earning and Spending Downtime ((++Earning and Spending Downtime))">​</a></h2>
<p>Time passes in Covalon at the same rate that time passes in real life. Player characters gain one day of downtime to spend for every real life day that passes, and can spend their downtime whenever they&#x27;re not currently participating in an adventure by logging it in the appropriate channel. If you forget to log your downtime, you can log those days of missed downtime if they were missed within the past week - any days before that are lost. You may not log missed downtime for activities that your characters wouldn&#x27;t have been able to perform on those days - for example, if you missed logging your downtime on Wednesday, you couldn&#x27;t log it on Friday to spend it on crafting an item from a formula you acquired on Thursday. Eidolons, companions, and familiars cannot participate in downtime activities.</p>
<p>Players are required to roll their downtime checks in #downtime-rolls, using our Dice Maiden bot. When rolling, please include the reason for the roll in the roll command. For example, if you were rolling a check to Earn Income using Performance and you had a +7 bonus to Performance, you would type:
math (
/roll 1d20+7 !Earn Income
)</p>
<p>The exact time at which player characters gain a day of downtime to spend is at midnight server time every day.</p>
<p>/</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="earn-income-earn-income">Earn Income ((+++Earn Income))<a href="#earn-income-earn-income" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Earn Income ((+++Earn Income))" title="Direct link to Earn Income ((+++Earn Income))">​</a></h3>
<p>When using the Earn Income activity, you must roll for each individual day of downtime spent instead of once for every four days, and you can choose a Task Level up to the settlement&#x27;s level (which can be found in the Covalon Gazetteer) or your character&#x27;s level, whichever is lower. If you are a member of a Guild, you earn 1 Hero Point for every five days of downtime you spend to Earn Income using a skill related to your Guild (these days do not have to be consecutive). When you critically fail a check to earn income, you earn nothing for that day&#x27;s work, but you are not prevented from attempting again tomorrow or in the future.</p>

<p>Due to the very limited equipment options available at the General Store, players will need to obtain most of the items they need through crafting. The crafting hall sells formulas for all common items with a level less than or equal to the settlement&#x27;s level, but higher level formulas or formulas that are uncommon or rarer will can only be recovered from adventures. Formulas found on adventures and formulas invented by players (either through deconstruction or the Inventor feat) can be posted on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WpVq0OUl0jGqQNaYonDDJEmdGMiRynHVLnqjGmkTg4c/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public bulletin board</a> - these formulas are free for anyone to copy.</p>

<p>The DC to craft an item can be found on the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DCs by Level</a> table on page 503 of the CRB. In Covalon, we adjust the DC when crafting uncommon or rarer items as per the <a href="https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adjusting Difficulty</a> rules. If you have the Inventor feat, the DC to Invent the formula for an item is equal to the DC to craft that item. Many effects - such as Guidance - don&#x27;t last long enough to benefit a Craft check.

<p>Instead of using the traditional Earn Income activity, you can instead choose to Gather Resources using an applicable Lore skill. Gathering resources earns you an amount of material suitable for crafting equal to double the amount you would earn for performing Earn Income at an equivalent task level, and you can Gather Resources up to your character level, regardless of Covalon&#x27;s settlement level. For example, a level 1 player character trained in Mining Lore could choose to gather generic ore, which would earn them 4 sp worth of ore on a success instead of the 2 sp in coin normally earned from Earn Income, and could be used in lieu of gold when crafting a metal item. Crafting material obtained this way can alternatively be sold to the General Store for half value. All feats and abilities which specifically affect the Earn Income ability also affect Gather Resources, and the DC to Gather Resources for a particular Task Level is equivalent to the DC to Earn Income for that same Task Level.</p>
<p>Gathering resources can also be used to obtain precious materials for crafting. The following table contains all of the precious materials that can currently be gathered in Covalon. More varieties of precious materials may become available in the future as Covalon expands and players discover new sources of materials.</p>

<p>Covalon&#x27;s robust training facility and expansive library allows characters to retrain faster than in a traditional campaign. Retraining a feat, skill increase, or spell in a spell repertoire takes only four days of downtime, and retraining any other type of class feature only takes fourteen days. The use of these amenities is not free, however - for every day spent retraining, your character must pay the amount of gold listed for their level in Table 3-3: Retraining Costs.</p>
<p>Ancestry, heritage, background, class, and ability scores cannot be retrained. A player who wishes to change these things about their character will need to undergo a Terran Reincarnation ritual instead.</p>

<p>The advanced facilities in the crafting hall allow you to work on a project in tandem with multiple crafters. When using the Craft downtime activity, other player characters can spend their downtime to accelerate the rate at which you Craft an item - for the purpose of this activity, they are treated as &quot;secondary crafters.&quot; To serve as a secondary crafter, a player must meet all of the requirements to Craft the item (including knowing the formula). For each secondary crafter spending a day of downtime to work on the item, one additional day of downtime is contributed to the item&#x27;s creation, using the same rules for reducing the completion price of the item as if the secondary crafter was crafting the item themselves. After the initial four days of crafting, only you attempt the required check; the secondary crafters do not make a check and do not assist.

Jikret and Drusk both spend two days of downtime working on the item, after which, Jikret achieves a 17 on his check to Craft the full plate armor - a success! For each additional day Jikret and Drusk spend working on the item, they will reduce the item&#x27;s completion price. Jikret is 3rd level and trained in Crafting, so he reduces the item&#x27;s completion price by 5 sp per additional day of work.

<strong>Requirements</strong> You have taken a sample of a creature defeated during an adventure with the beast or animal trait, and you have had this creature sample approved after submitting a ticket.<a href="#covalon-downtimerequirements-you-have-taken-a-sample-of-a-creature-defeated-during-an-adventure-with-the-beast-or-animal-trait-and-you-have-had-this-creature-sample-approved-after-submitting-a-ticket" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to covalon-downtimerequirements-you-have-taken-a-sample-of-a-creature-defeated-during-an-adventure-with-the-beast-or-animal-trait-and-you-have-had-this-creature-sample-approved-after-submitting-a-ticket" title="Direct link to covalon-downtimerequirements-you-have-taken-a-sample-of-a-creature-defeated-during-an-adventure-with-the-beast-or-animal-trait-and-you-have-had-this-creature-sample-approved-after-submitting-a-ticket">​</a></h2>
<p>You invoke the power of the Heart of Terra to create a new creature from the sample of an old one. The Heart consumes the sample you provide it and produces an egg, which you spend seven days of consecutive downtime to incubate and care for. After seven days, this egg hatches into a creature of the same species as the one from the provided sample. If you have a feat or feature that gives you access to an animal companion, this creature can serve as your animal companion, using the stat blocks of a similar type of animal companion if an entry for this creature does not exist. Alternatively, the creature may be kept as a vanity pet, and you can own a maximum of four vanity pets.</p>
<p>In order for a creature to be approved for Raise a Creature, it must have the animal or beast tag, not be a Maw-related creature, not have any vaguely humanoid characteristics, not have the Spirit or Dragon tag, and must not be a custom or 3rd-party creature. Creatures created from Raise a Creature have their diet changed to consist of meat or plants commonly found in rations and have none of the abilities or spellcasting usually associated with their creature type (though they keep their forms of movement). Vanity pets become small or tiny in size, have their intelligence modifier reduced to -4, and lose the ability to speak any languages. Creatures hatched via the Raise a Creature activity can be traded to other players.

<p>The Terran Reincarnation ritual was invented by the Seekers of Secrets as a method of harnessing the Heart of Terra&#x27;s ambient magic to allow people to change their biology, personality, and aptitudes. For some, these changes help them adapt better to a post-Cataclysm world, and for others, it allows them to assume their perfect idea of themself in order to better defend the last bastion of civilization.</p>

<h1>Roleplay ((+Roleplay))</h1>
<p>Covalon features several special systems designed to facilitate and enhance roleplaying experiences. Participating in these systems allows for both veteran and new roleplayers alike to enrich their gameplay between adventures with meaningful interplayer engagement.</p>

<p>Players who wish to team up with like-minded adventurers and form a permenant company can do so by creating a guild. Guilds are player-led groups that gain access to several features, such as private text &amp; voice channels, hosting roleplay events, and enacting narrative projects around the city. Additionally, members of a guild who spend five days of downtime on Earn Income using a skill related to their guild (at the discretion of the guild leader) gain 1 Hero Point.</p>

<h1>Roleplay Events/Narrative Projects</h1>
<p>Members of a guild can run server events that award 1 Hero Point to all participants. After a guild hosts an event or project, their member cap is raised by 2. To host a roleplay event or start a narrative project (such as building a statue or a building), please have your guild leader #create-a-ticket with the following information:
Event Name, Date, Location, Summary of Event, Event Goals, and the in-character announcement post for your event to be shared in the #official-postings channel.

<ul>
<li>A new guild needs at least three members to form.</li>
<li>A guild needs a unique name, purpose, and heraldry.</li>
<li>A registration fee of 50 gp must be paid. Alternatively, a fee of 500 gp can be paid to have a guild hall constructed for the guild along with the registration (see the &quot;Houses, Businesses, and Guild Halls&quot; section).
)</li>
</ul>
<p>When these three requirements are met, the guild leader can #create-a-ticket to submit their guild to the staff team. If they approve, the guild will become official.</p>
<p>Players may be in a maximum of two guilds, and a guild may have a maximum of 10 members. This member cap is raised by 2 after a guild hosts an event or project.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen your housing district, you may discuss the overall design with the City Planner and request a map. Houses consist of four bedrooms, a common living area, a kitchen, a bathroom, and one unique feature, such as a training room, crafting workshop, or study, though exceptions can be made with the approval of the City Planner. Housing lots are 75&#x27; x 75&#x27; (15 x 15 grid). This includes all exterior features, such as gardens. Lots must contain at least one square of green space around the building, and the building must be no taller than two stories (including anything below ground).

<p>Covalon is a city, and like all cities, its citizens must follow laws or face consequences. But Covalon is also a roleplaying game, and what would a roleplaying game be without a little bit of crime now and then? In Covalon, laws are categorized into four groups of severity, where more severe crimes result in more severe punishments. The first three categories of severity are referred to as &quot;Roleplay Laws,&quot; and the consequences for breaking these laws is restricted to roleplay only (such as being asked to do community service or serve jail time). The fourth category of severity details crimes that go against our Player Expectations; if any of these crimes are committed, there will be significant out-of-character consequences, which could include dismissal from the campaign. While we encourage players to interact with the Roleplay Laws in ways that enhance their roleplaying experience, we forbid players from breaking any of the laws that coincide with our Player Expectations (known as Extreme Offenses). Additionally, before a player character commits a crime against another player character(s), all involved players must privately and explicitly consent to the interaction. If your character becomes the victim of a roleplay crime that you did not explicitly consent to, please #create-a-ticket and let the staff team know immediately.</p>
<p>=</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roleplay-laws-roleplay-laws">Roleplay Laws ((+++Roleplay Laws))<a href="#roleplay-laws-roleplay-laws" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roleplay Laws ((+++Roleplay Laws))" title="Direct link to Roleplay Laws ((+++Roleplay Laws))">​</a></h3>
<p>If a player character breaks a Roleplay Law, the crime can be reported by the victim of the crime, any witness to the crime, or the perpetrator themselves (if they feel guilty and want to turn themselves in). Depending on the severity of the crime, an appropriate consequence will be administered. These consequences only exist for the purposes of roleplaying and have no effect on mechanical aspects of the server, such adventures or downtime systems. A player character who commits an Infraction will receive an official warning and may be ordered to take remedial classes. A player character who commits a Misdemeanor will be asked to complete community service as atonement. Lastly, a player who commits a Felony must atone for it by serving jail time. With forenotice, the staff team can use the Chronicler account to act as NPC guards in a roleplay scene.</p>
<p>note(</p>
<h1>Crime as a Storytelling Device</h1>
<p>Committing a crime can be a fun way to spice up roleplaying, especially when used to drive character development. For example, a character might steal something and be so riddled with guilt afterwards that they make a point to always do the right thing in the future, or a character might vandalize another character&#x27;s business to ignite a conflict between the two. Remember to always ask for permission before committing a crime against another player&#x27;s character, and inform the staff team via #create-a-ticket. The staff team will determine if the city of Covalon takes legal action against a character after a crime is commited.

<p>Sometimes, when a crime is reported, the evidence isn&#x27;t clear enough to support a conviction against a player character, or the victim or criminal may want to argue that a consequence for a particular instance of a crime should be more or less severe. In either of these circumstances, a trial can be requested by a victim or criminal. During a trial, a plaintiff (either the victim, their appointed representative, or a representative for the city of Covalon) and the defendant (either the alleged criminal, convicted criminal, or their appointed representative) argue their case before a staff member(s) (roleplaying as a Covalon NPC judge) and a panel of six jurors, made up of randomly selected volunteers. The staff member(s) will guide the trial by asking questions and instructing the plaintiff and defendant when to present their evidence or call for witness testimonies. After all evidence has been presented and arguments have been made, the jury will determine the outcome of the case via a simple majority vote. After the vote, the details of sentencing (if applicable) will be determined by the staff member(s).</p>
<p>Like other role playing events, upcoming trials are scheduled in the #scheduled-events channel, and players may sign up to potentially serve on the jury. No XP or gold is awarded, but all jurors earn a Hero Point for their service. Trials can take place over voice chat or text chat, and should not last more than two hours.</p>

<p>The world of Elleaterra, home of Covalon, is separate from Golarion. Locations, deities, and other Golarion-specific setting lore does not exist in Covalon. Though the outer planes and their non-deific inhabitants are similar, Covalon is a setting that is completely separate and unique from Paizo&#x27;s Golarion.</p>
<h1>Basic Lore ((+Basic Lore))</h1>
<p>The world of Elleaterra is vast, home to many different types of creatures and cultures. Though they all have generations of personal, familial, and national history, a period of wanton destruction has forced these varied peoples to cooperate in order to survive a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-cataclysm-the-cataclysm">The Cataclysm ((++The Cataclysm))<a href="#the-cataclysm-the-cataclysm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Cataclysm ((++The Cataclysm))" title="Direct link to The Cataclysm ((++The Cataclysm))">​</a></h2>
<p>The old world is gone. Dragons, undead, planar invaders, and natural disasters desecrated the nations of our world, Elleaterra, over a period of a few months collectively referred to as &quot;the Cataclysm.&quot; Monsters roam the land, survivors raid each other for supplies, and the gods have stopped answering prayers. Four years later, only one pocket of civilization remains: Covalon.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="covalon-covalon">Covalon ((++Covalon))<a href="#covalon-covalon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Covalon ((++Covalon))" title="Direct link to Covalon ((++Covalon))">​</a></h2>
<p>Formerly a keep on nearly inhospitable land given to a baron of low standing, Covalon has evolved into the last bastion of civilization in a post-Cataclysm world. Against all odds, a small keep of ragtag survivors has evolved into a bustling and thriving town, with survivors from all corners of the world flocking to its gates. Founded by the late Baron Freetide, Covalon managed to survive the Cataclysm due to a unique, living artifact hidden within its walls: the Heart of Terra. In his final days, Baron Freetide appointed a sheriff to manage Covalon&#x27;s affairs, but with the sheriff&#x27;s unexpected exodus from the city, the mantle of leadership was taken on by seven councilors. As the non-adventuring population of Covalon has grown, NPCs have stepped up to manage and govern most of the back-end of the City, so adventurers can focus on adventuring!</p>

<p>Predating the cataclysm, the Heart of Terra is the living artifact responsible for Covalon&#x27;s survival. Taking the shape of a planetarium with a miniature world at its center, the Heart of Terra infuses the land around Covalon with good soil, clean water, and temperate weather. Outside, the wasteland is cruel and desolate, but the Heart has created a magical oasis from which mortals can make their last stand.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-maw-the-maw-1">The Maw ((++The Maw))<a href="#the-maw-the-maw-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Maw ((++The Maw))" title="Direct link to The Maw ((++The Maw))">​</a></h2>
<p>The Maw is the name given to the terrifying abyss in the desert to the south of Covalon. It is a living entity that singularly seeks the destruction of Covalon, spawning armies of abberrant creatures to carry out this task. Though it existed long before the Cataclysm, it wasn&#x27;t until the aftermath of the world-ending crisis that it became bent on Covalon&#x27;s destruction. Scholars discovered that the Maw has a physical Heart that could be killed to destroy the Maw for good, and Covalon launched a massive offensive into the Maw to carry out this task, known as Operation Heartbreaker. Just as it seemed like they had defeated the Heart of the Maw, it received a surge of life energy from somewhere outside the Maw and overwhelmed Covalon&#x27;s forces. The people of Covalon were able to retreat thanks to the selfless sacrifice of heavenly archons who had arrived to fight alongside them, but were unsuccessful in defeating the Heart of the Maw.</p>
<p>Since then, the citizens have discovered that the surge of life energy the Heart of the Maw received came from Maw Vessels - nodes of power scattered throughout the world. Covalon has launched a series of expeditions to find these Vessels, destroy them, and in doing so, reclaim the civilizations that were lost to the Cataclysm.</p>

</p><h1>The Siege of Covalon</h1><p></p>
<p>When Covalon&#x27;s walls were young and untested there came a time where dark clouds formed on the desert horizon. Day after day the darkness grew, hungrily eating at sky. Scouts told of purple lightning balling and piercing through the roiling clouds as anguished cries echoed from the maw&#x27;s chasm. While as yet unaware of what this foretold, the adventurers of Covalon set to prepare in the best ways they knew how. Each did as they could. Some produced bandages and medicines, blacksmiths forged armor and sharpened weapons, and the bookish sought to uncover the secrets of the vile sorcery that had begun to blot out the sun over their heads. A keening wind brought news of undeath walking the dunes as nightmares plagued Covalon&#x27;s dreamers.</p>
<p>Creeping, crawling, hungry hordes of undead made their approach, but this was no ordinary undead menace. These mindless monsters moved in strategic formations, halting and maneuvering as though beckoned by an unseen and demanding hand. On the sands outside of ranged attacks, they waited, standing at grisly attention, threatening to at any moment bear down upon the survivors of the world&#x27;s apocalypse. Finally the true threat prepared to make itself known. A titanic five legged Dracolich shook the earth as it clawed its way out from the maw to drive its armies of horror forward! Covalon&#x27;s defenders prepared themselves for the fight of their lives, forming five squads of her strongest and most guileful to assault the massive beast. Their plan, Operation Siege Breaker, was to cut it down to size, assaulting each leg simultaneously while a brave vanguard kept at its head to hold its attention on themselves.</p>
<p>As the hordes of undead descended to assault the walls, the heroes of covalon cut through waves of horrors towards their targets. The battle raged and the monster seemed poised to overtake the vanguard who were reeling on the edge of life when finally the beast was brought down by a powerful kick that destroyed its vestigal fifth leg. With the dracolich destroyed there was no hand to control the undead hordes and they too fell or fled back whence they came.</p>

<h1>Covalon Gazetteer ((+Covalon Gazetteer))</h1>
<p>Before the Cataclysm, Covalon was nothing more than a small fief of nearly inhospitable land entrusted to the lesser baron Eagor Freetide as a cruel joke. But in a fortuitous twist of fate, the baron would discover something worth protecting in the wasteland - the seed of an artifact we now know as the Heart of Terra. The power of the heart protected Covalon from the destruction wrought by the Cataclysm; while his home kingdom was razed to the ground by dragons, the baron enjoyed peace and safety in Covalon. In the aftermath of the chaos, survivors began turning up at the gates of Covalon, and Baron Freetide welcomed them in with open arms, determined to rise to the responsibility fate had set before him.</p>
<p>Months later, the baron passed away due to natural causes, and the responsibility of leadership was thrust upon the heads of each of Covalon&#x27;s major organizations and the City Planner. As Covalon&#x27;s non-adventuring population grew, NPC stepped up to manage most of the day to day governing of the city.</p>

<p>Though the gods have gone silent, many citizens of Covalon cling to their faith in hopes that the divines will deliver them from the horrors of the outside world. Covalon&#x27;s chapel, staffed by NPC holy folk and the Servants of Terra guild, endeavors to provide religious services for all of the different faiths in Covalon, as well as a place of rest for those who have fought their last battle.</p>

<p>Covalon&#x27;s crafters, inventors, and engineers are the backbone of its development, and many of them congregate in the crafting hall to collaborate on projects and share techniques. Some basic common formulas can be purchased from the hall&#x27;s resident staff, while rarer and more advanced formulas are posted to bulletin boards by adventurers who discover them out in the world.</p>

<h1>Market District ((++Market District))</h1>
<p>A far cry from the hustle and bustle of cities past, Covalon&#x27;s marketplace nevertheless does its best to service its citizens with everything they need. Though most of the stalls that line the marketplace only sell mundane items, adventurers sometimes set up stands to sell magical equipment or alchemical supplies that they&#x27;ve found on their adventures or created themselves.</p>

<p>Adventurers run on bread and beer, and the adventurers of Covalon are no different. The Brass Snail is the premiere location for the city&#x27;s intrepid explorers and grizzled warriors to relax after a day&#x27;s adventurers, complete with rooms for staying overnight and a public stage often utilized by Covalon&#x27;s troupe of performers. The proprieter, Drusk (N male lizardfolk bartender), is always around to serve thirsty patrons, and some adventurers choose to work at the Snail in between adventures as well.</p>

<p>Though once the only store in Covalon, the General Store has since been overshadowed by the myriad of stalls in the marketplace and the fancy new businesses founded by ambitious citizens.

The store is owned by the mysterious Qetello Fate-Weaver (NG nonbinary human witch), a fortune-teller who inherited it from the former regent of Covalon and has since expanded it into a supply station for all adventurers new to the city. Newcomers can often be seen walking into the Weaver&#x27;s Web with a smile and walking out with gear and potions; Qetello is as charitable as they are enigmatic!</p>

Curse removal and potions are common purchases, but the store is also known for two specialties: serums of sex shift and careful uses of the bestial curse to help others try and find their true selves.</p>

Here, guild members will usually man the bar or hang around with any would be patrons, offering a conversation, a drink, some song, a good story or just the warmth of the big fireplace that is always aflame to warm any weary soul. When not being used as a gathering spot for social meetings among friends or for events, The Fireside is also a hub for new dungeoneers to come ask for some help, whether in need of basic gear or just searching for tips on how to stay alive for longer out there.</p>

<p>Nestled in the hills of the north gate district, an awe-inspiring monument stands tall . Behold Rumil Azanul, the Mountain Home both in name and purpose. This great hall symbolizes the alliance of the surviving dwarven clans, united to rebuild and preserve the ancient customs and artisnal crafts of thier people.</p>
<p>A visit to Rumil Azanul immerses you in the rich tapestry of traditional dwarven architecture. Greeting you at its entrance is a life-sized marble sentinel, a tribute to an Ironbeard warrior from Whitespire. As you step inside, the lofty arched corridors unfold, adorned with vivid frescoes narrating the epic sagas of dwarven history and showcasing recent triumphs against formidable adversaries. \</p>
<p>The centerpiece of this magnificent hold is its grand hall, where a colossal table with twelve regal seats command attention. Despite the spaciousness, an inviting warmth envelops the room. Beyond the great hall, a series of doors beckon, leading to the dormitories and descending stairs that reveal the true heart of Rumil Azanul: the workshop.</p>
<p>Nestled directly beneath the great hall, the workshop plays host to an expansive and intricately designed forge, surrounded by a multitude of work tables and anvils. It&#x27;s immediately apparent, even to those unfamiliar with such domains, that this is where the bulk of their efforts went into construction, and likely where the guild members dedicate their time and skill. Within these hallowed walls, the legacy of the dwarven clans is expertly crafted and preserved for generations to come.</p>

After repelling the Maw&#x27;s undead armies and their skeletal draconic general during the Siege of Covalon, the city has managed to establish an outpost among the edge of the Maw.

<p><strong>Fate</strong> madness and undead</p>
<p>Alatar was built on a mountain range close to the ocean and made up of many small governments in a loose alliance with one another. All gods were worshipped there. If more than 1 person had different religious views, it was common practice to simply not talk about religion with said people. Communities with more status typically lived higher up in the mountains as the land was believed to be closer to the gods.</p>
<p>At the very tops of the mountains lived the communities known as peak communities, of which there were 6. They had high expectations placed on them from those in their respective communities. They also typically only worshipped 1 or 2 deities per community, as religious obligations sometimes conflicted with laws otherwise. The laws were significantly stricter than those who lived lower down the mountains in terms of the punishments and definitions of the laws. They were usually the example for the lower communities to follow. Lying was extremely frowned upon as a result of Aelia’s overall strong influence and the fact that people just don’t like being lied to in general. In fact, in many communities, but not all, it was illegal to lie. It was also illegal for two communities to go to war.</p>
<p>After the Cataclysm, a wave of evil and negative energies rained down from the sky. The dead came to life and the living went mad. The laws in the higher communities became so absurdly strict that even the most rigidly lawful people couldn’t hope to follow all of their laws unless they were born and raised there. The madness also led to a distaste for outsiders, which kept many people there for a long time. Meanwhile the undead rose again and again, slowly but surely eating away at civilisation.</p>

<p>The Armed Steppes surround the Tengeriin Uul Mountains and stretch from the Fey Courts to the northwest and Garn to the south. The rockier steppes to the north are predominantly inhabited by warring hordes, competing tooth and nail for sparse natural resources. The greener lakeside steppes to the south are mostly inhabited by descendants of nomad tribes that managed to settle down a few generations ago.</p>
<p>Millenia ago, the Tengeriin Uul Mountains served as a focal point for outsiders venturing into the material plane. While those visits decreased over the ages, their influence remained. This led to irreparable damage to the surrounding land, causing resource scarcity and forcing the inhabitants into a largely nomadic lifestyle. Culturally, they became a place of pilgrimage for many, due to their connection to the outer planes, though some clans held strongly onto the grudges of the region and persecuted those planar scions who bore the blood of the outsiders who once were common here.</p>

<p>Drifthaven was a relatively small town of peace loving folk. Much of their time was spent in revelry, often throwing large parties involving the entire town to celebrate anything from the changing of the seasons, to a group of people being in a particularly good mood that evening. Home to many artists and makers of music, a celebration had here was generally fairly memorable. The folks of the town welcomed travelers with open arms, encouraging them to stay around and enjoy events they had in town. Music, ale, and other creature comforts were traded for goods and news from the outside very often. The people of Drifthaven themselves hardly ever left their own borders. The town itself was comprised of almost no physical buildings besides a silo, a storehouse, and a stable. All other buildings were canvas structures, such as tents, pavilions, and their ilk. Most denizens of Drifthaven could speak both Common and Sylvan. Due to their down to earth mentality, most preferred the Sylvan language so much it became notable as their regional language. Swords, Daggers, Flails, and most weapons were strictly prohibited within the borders of Drifthaven. To be caught with a weapon was grounds for immediate banishment from the premises. Due to this, there was no military force. Due to a very low crime rate, law enforcement was minimal at best. A band of no more than 20 people at a time with minimal training in non lethal weapons kept the peace in large gatherings. Because incidents were so low, they were hardly ever needed.</p>
<p>The Cataclysm ended Drifthaven in a swarm of undead. Due to a distinct lack of military might, the tent city was destroyed in a matter of hours. Very few are expected to have survived.

<p>Gornlar began as a collection of hunters and mercenaries constructing hunting outposts in fertile hunting grounds. After finding many plentiful mountainsides lined with mines, they began unifying together as a single entity. Their weapons, armor, and military might was widely considered threatening, but too chaotic to truly be feared. Multiple warlords from each outpost bickered and even fought amongst themselves over territory within the collective. As the freeholds began to grow, they began to overthrow smaller nations. Eventually, they established themselves as an official freehold. As the end of days came, mighty dragons descended from the mountains and brought ruin to the freeholds.

<p>Efforts to reclaim Gornlar are underway. Due to the presence of roaming dragons, the safest way to approach Gornlar was to use Covalon&#x27;s clockwork drill to bore a tunnel through the mountains to the west of Covalon. The drill needed significant upgrades in order to complete this task, including layers of potency crystal coating to empower its drill bit, fulus of fire suppression to keep its temperature under control, and black powder kegs to blast through anything that the drill can&#x27;t penetrate. The crafty adventurers of Trella&#x27;s Travelers took charge in augmenting the drill, transforming it into a mechanical marvel known as The Den Maker.</p>

<p>Upon breaching the final mountain between Covalon and Gornlar&#x27;s territory, the drill was immediately set upon by a pair of ancient dragons, and amidst a raging storm of frost and magma, kicked itself into overdrive to burrow into a nearby cliff for safety. The drill&#x27;s operational time expired, the Covalonians found themselves unable to get any closer to the former freeholds. Luckily, the drill uncovered a series of tunnels that led into the domains of the two dragons - a conjoined pair of mountains, one covered in flame, and the other covered in frost. By exploring these mountains, the adventurers were able to discover information crucuial to defeating the two dragons.</p>
<p>Ashgut, the magma dragon, and Fjordcarver, the white dragon, were mortal enemies for centuries before they both knocked each other into comas in a particularly fierce battle. The cataclysm reawakened the two dragons, and their ensuing battles razed the Gornlar freeholds to the ground. The Covalonians found that these two mighty dragons were nigh invincible when challenged on their own, but by battling both at the same time, they were able to turn the dragons&#x27; elemental powers against them. Ashgut and Fjordcarver were felled in a ravine at the intersection of the conjoined mountains, where a Vessel of the Maw was discovered and summarily destroyed by our own Seed of Terra.</p>

<p><strong>Geography</strong> tropical island</p>
<p><strong>Fate</strong> environmental catastrophe</p>
<p>Out of the thousands of islands in the Noctune Tropic archipelago, only a fraction have been charted, and only a fraction of those are even worth mentioning. Upon one of such islands once sat the republic of Ikouga - a hub of trade between the other islands in the Tropic and other major civilizations such as Primrose and Gornlar. The city boasted an impressive navy that allowed it to stay separate from international politics, as well as enough ne&#x27;er-do-well privateers to keep it busy. Its idyllic climate and acces to a wealth of natural resources made it an attractive place for those both looking to fill their purse and their minds, housing headquarters for several international trading companies as well as an academy of magic and science. In time, Ikouga&#x27;s technology grew and urban development expanded, with the city encompassing more and more of the original island with every passing year, until the city expanded to the point where the entire original island had been covered by city - no original tropical forest remained.</p>
<p>In spite of their wealth and knowledge, the denizens of Ikouga found themselves powerless on the day the wind stopped and the ocean stood still. Over the weeks that followed, civilization in Ikouga completely destabilized from being cut off from the rest of the world, and the city descended to anarchy. Some people were killed over conflicts for food while others merely starved to death, but the greatest fools of all were the ones who attempted to flee the city by rowboat; although the ocean&#x27;s surface stood still, the beasts below the surface were more restless than ever.

<p>Efforts to reclaim Ikouga are complete! Thanks to the contributions of Kelani Snowdrop and other citizens, Covalon was able to construct a galley and a large number of feather tokens (fan) to propel them across the windless ocean of the Noctune Tropic. Dubbed <em>The North Star</em>, adventurers boarded the Trella-themed vessel with starry eyes, eager to see what awaited them in Ikouga.</p>
<p>On the last leg of the journey, disaster struck. The ship was attacked by an unseen creature below the waves of the ocean, and the ship crashed onto the city&#x27;s beach. Luckily, everyone survived, and a base camp was erected on Ikouga&#x27;s docks. A portal has been created between the base camp at Ikouga and Covalon, but <em>The North Star</em> won&#x27;t be sailing anywhere else until she receives repairs.</p>

<p>While exploring Ikouga and the surrounding islands, adventurers managed to unravel the mystery of the fate that befell Ikouga. Ancient Ikougans worshipped a legendary sea monster called Scylladon, the Starbreaker, which they believed had been responsible for creating the islands in the Noctune Tropic. Not only did Scylladon turn out to be real, it had also been corrupted by the foul energies of the Maw, enslaved to guard one of the Maw&#x27;s vile Vessels that formed underneath the island. Scylladon was defeated by a bold contingent of Covalonians who targeted the creature&#x27;s vulnerable tentacles instead of its heavily armored body. Since the creature&#x27;s defeat and the destruction of the Maw Vessel, the wind has returned to Ikouga, which may allow civilization to flourish there once again.</p>

<p>Kuraimori (or 暗い森), the empire that never shun sunlight, illuminated its glorious lands with lanterns, glowing mushrooms and vibrant cherry blossoms. It was a civilization that never feared death, for the people shared a spiritual connection with those who have passed on and allowed them to live in harmony with their ancestors and loved ones. Many festivals were created to honor the dead, crafting handmade paper lanterns and letting them float down the ocean to pay respects. Those with sunlight sensitivity or preferred the shadows often found peace in Kuraimori for the daytime never came, relying on only the illumination of its natural surroundings to see the path ahead. Languages such as Necril and Shadowtongue were commonly spoken but Common remained most used for the diversity of people who found home in Kuraimori. Fashion and beauty was heavily adored, the citizens of the Dark Empire would tailor and create vibrant outfits such as kimonos, hanboks, hakamas and more. Each would accessorize their handmade clothing with glowing cosmetics and vibrant jewelry to express their deep care in beauty and representation of Kuraimori. The magically adept were very common, this meant a lack of weaponry and arms to purchase or create which led to a very low crime rate. All were welcome to Kuraimori as long as one very important law was followed: respect the dead and live among them in harmony.</p>
<p>When the Cataclysm arose, celestials sought out Kuraimori seeing its never ending darkness as a threat. Tearing down the Dark Empire and engulfing it with searing holy energy nothing but the blinding light encased the area, leaving spirits unrested and forgotten.</p>

<p>The town of Middlemist is a town hidden away from the eyes of mortals. The inhabitants are all Leshies that have either been abandoned, outlived, or escaped the druids that made them. This town was prosperous due to the natural bounty of the forest and the high-quality potions they produced. They traded with other villages through select merchants that would come and go. When the Calamity came, the forest was engulfed in supernatural darkness, and Middlemist hasn&#x27;t been seen since.

<p>Our efforts to reclaim Middlemist are complete! To get to the lost lands of Middlemist we would have to travel further than ever before, across both land and sea. To this end the brightest minds in Covalon gathered to develop the plans for a vehicle for this very purpose, an airship! The Harbinger, as it would be called, was swiftly crafted by the citizens of our city and we set forth through the skies.</p>
<p>What we found though was not the mist shrouded forest our records recalled but instead a grim pall of shadow. We set up camp on the outskirts of these endarkened woods and prepared our venture within. After piercing the veil of darkness we found that the land within had become corrupted by the energies of the Maw. The trees had become twisted and angry, the animals hostile and driven mad by some unknown force. Fighting against the land itself we delved deeper and deeper into the darkness until we found the greatest horror of all, innocent leshies being siphoned of their life by terrible roots to feed some unseen entity.
/</p>
<p>This entity turned out to be the Shadow Titan, a being of pure shadow, composed of two grasping hands and a hideous visage all working in tandem to attempt to thwart our attempts to reclaim Middlemist from darkness. Though bombarded with a torrent of lasers, slaps and shadowspawn we were ultimately triumphant. We destroyed the Vessel of the Maw and shed light on Middlemist once more.</p>

<p>Primrose was the result of Kujanite doctrine giving birth to a culture obsessed with expanding and developing civilization. Though it once had a reputation as an extremely fair and open society, a few mercantile organizations grew powerful enough to wrest control of the city away from its citizens. Centuries of these &quot;Primrose Shahs&quot; worshipped a splinter aspect of the city&#x27;s traditional god which they called &quot;Al-Kujani,&quot; believing that only by amassing as much wealth and power as possible would they be able to stave off an eventual &quot;Return to the Sands.&quot; Unfortunately, their skyscraping palaces fared no better against the Cataclysm than the rest of Primrose&#x27;s streets and boroughs.

<p>Efforts to reclaim Primrose are underway... sort of. The city had been buried under the dunes of the desert, and conventional reclamation was mostly out of the question, but it was entirely possible that some buildings may have survived and could be dug into. Trella&#x27;s Travelers constructed the <em>Oasis Seeker</em> for this purpose - an alchemical scorpion mech that would be able to dig into the desert while crystallizing the sand left in its wake to prevent cave-ins. The journey was tumultuous and risky, with the <em>Oasis Seeker</em> threatening to fall apart at multiple points throughout the journey, but the Covalonians eventually reached Primrose and managed to bore into its underground sewer system known as the Ratways... or so they thought.</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>The floor of the sewers gave out beneath the hulking mech, and the Covalonians fell into a massive underground cavern. From atop a tall shelf, they looked down and saw myriads of colorful lights dancing among sandstone monuments. As their eyes adjusted to the darkness they could make out buildings, streets, and a huge palace - they had discovered a thriving city far underneath Primrose! Their arrival did not go unnoticed. A small fire wisp approached the camp and delivered an envelope sealed with the mark of a Shah - one of Primrose&#x27;s oligarchal elite. It contained a letter from Al-Fazim, a former noble of Primrose who now called herself a Shah of Duneveil. She explained that the city below them was an ancient civilization devoted to uncovering the secrets of immortality, and that in the wake of the Cataclysm, the Shahs of Primrose had usurped the city and taken command. Their sultan has plans to raise an army of undead and elementals in order to reconquer the surface world, but Al-Fazim and the other Shahs of Primrose have offered to help the Covalonians put a stop to his plans in return for assisting their own ambitious agendas. In addition to potentially locating a Vessel of the Maw, the Covalonians now find themselves tasked with infiltrating a city, sowing political discord, and overthrowing a tyrant before a new force of destruction comes for their homes.</p>

<p>Ratchethallow was a relatively small city, specialising in the march of mechanical progress. Whirring cogs, whistling machines and trundling belts lined the cramped walkways of the city. Between brass houses and belching furnaces, the city attracted the brightest and most curious minds. Nowhere else in Elleaterra could boast such unfettered access to raw materials, precision tools and most importantly a distinct lack of bureaucratic red tape. Ratchethallow knew that failure was just a step towards progress, and that so called ‘Safety Regulations’ prevented progress more than any explosion could!</p>
<p>Yet even Ratchethallow knew that the Cataclysm would claim them eventually. The brightest minds converged in the development of the city’s greatest machine yet. A sprawling mass of exposing wiring, tubes and ingenuity designed to keep the city safe from even the unstoppable forces of the Cataclysm. Nothing was heard from Ratchethallow after the day the machine was due to be powered on. The fate of Ratchethallow remains unknown.

<p>Efforts to reclaim Ratchethallow are complete! The greater community of Covalon’s engineers and alchemists came together to design an all-terrain trackless train, which was named The Odyssey and set up to move out from the Middlemist camp. After an unscheduled stop in the forest due to a gunked-up engine, the Odyssey departed again, only to attract the attention of a flock of clockwork ravens, several of which found places among the crew as pets.</p>
<p>Covalon adventurers set up camp in a sandy strait several miles outside the dome before beginning subtle excursions into the city proper to observe the inhabitants there. Ratchethallow appeared primarily unoccupied at first glance, save for what appeared to be a veritable army of mechanized constructs, obeying the commands of a shadowy figure known only as the Lord of Gears. After several close calls with constructs following adventurers back to camp and nearly alerting the city to their presence, our adventurers managed to locate the Lord of Gears to a workshop in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>The Lord of Gears appeared to be a massive construct housed in a workshop in the center of the dome, his size only matched by his tactical intellect. A fervent ally of the Maw, he possessed a Vessel hidden in his workshop, and was an enormous threat in his own right. A group of brave adventurers faced him in combat, and emerged victorious after a grueling battle, having reclaimed the city of Ratchethallow.</p>

<p>Taltain was a small sovereign nation led by powerful noble families. Only humans lived a life of pleasure, coming from generations of wealth and fortune. They profited from the hard working lower class, offering them livable conditions as long as they continued to power the economical workhorse that was required to power their life styles. A number of well trained mercenary groups kept the families safe and were paid very handsomely for their duties.</p>
<p>Only a decade before the Cataclysm, the lower class sought aid from the nearby freeholds of Gornlar to overthrow their noble oppressors, staging an assault upon the island chains. With their help, the noble families of Taltain were all but decimated. Taltain, now ran by the usurping lower class, joined Gornlar as an official vassal. Ironically, the Cataclysm would manifest itself in Taltain by way of another coup. Faceless aberrations disguised as mercenaries infiltrated the city and slaughtered the citizens of Taltain indiscriminately.

<p>Efforts to reclaim Taltain are complete! After being shipwrecked while en route to Ikouga, the citizens of Covalon were wary of conventional sea travel, but the ocean needed to be crossed in order to reach Taltain. A submersible means of locomotion was deemed necessary in order to keep the traveling Covalonians safe from attacks, which led to the invention of a vessel built to resemble a sea monster: an apparatus of the octopus. Financed largely in part by resident cephalopod enthusiast Turner T. Turnip, the Tentacle&#x27;s Grasp jet its way through the western sea.</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>Bizarrely, the Tentacle&#x27;s Grasp reached Taltain without incident, and even more bizarrely, the Covalonian explorers found that they were not the only sentient inhabitants on Taltain. The entire city looked to be in pristine condition, bustling with people, as if the Cataclysm had never happened! This immediately raised suspicion among the explorers, who noticed that all of these people wore similar-looking wooden masks to cover their faces, and went about their routines with little regard to what was going on around them. Hiding themselves away in an abandoned tavern, the adventurers of Covalon engaged in infiltration missions to uncover the secret behind Taltain&#x27;s survival without bringing too much attention to themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, their efforts had paid off - they learned that there was indeed a Vessel of the Maw in Taltain, under guard by the city&#x27;s council in their government office. A group of bold Covalonians stormed the office and battled against an assembly of councilors eerily similar to Covalon&#x27;s own! Like the other people in Taltain, they operated under a single hivemind, but showed much more cohesion than their citizens - figuratively through their tactics, and literally as they combined their bodies together into an amalgam that was as powerful as it was hideous. After a grueling battle, the Covalonians prevailed, uncovering a Vessel of the Maw underneath the councilors&#x27; thrones and destroying it with the help of a Seed of Terra.</p>

<p><strong>Geography</strong> small island civilisation with rocky shores</p>
<p><strong>Fate</strong> swallowed by the ocean</p>
<p>Tarunga reigned as one of, if not the, naval powerhouses of Elleaterra. The island nation had regulated forests specifically for the production of ships, numerous port cities that served as waypoints in a ship&#x27;s travels, and warehouses filled with goods ready to ship. The capital, sharing the same name as the nation itself, was a sprawling port in which hundreds of ships could be seen coming and going.  Ruled by the Seven Guilds, whom all collaborated to ensure that proper practices were followed and the prices of goods were regulated correctly, helped Tarunga prosper.</p>
<p>When the Cataclysm came for Tarunga, it came in the form of swelling oceans and titan tsunamis. The Seven Guilds did their best to organize the nation, offloading much of the stored goods onto ships. By the time the island had been swallowed whole by the waves, most of the goods had been successfully transported away into what had become deadly waters. What became of those ships, only Gemni can tell.

<p>The small island of Tymoria is hidden within the Misty Sea, a large body of water in the shape of a waning moon. It is known to be a place of extreme primal power, even hosting a permanently open portal to the First World. This portal is the cause of the drastically diverse range of climates on the island, which has necessitated living in harmony with nature instead of building vast cities. A portion of the kingdom also lies within the First World, but most non-fey denizens of Tymoria don&#x27;t venture too far in, for there exist powerful creatures that do not fully follow the whims of the court.</p>
<p>The Cataclysm enshrouded Tymoria in a magical mist that defies navigation; any ships that sail into it are spit out in random locations elsewhere in the Misty Sea. No one has been able to visit Tymoria since.

<p><strong>Primary Exports</strong> wine, spices, lumber, darkwood, stone, crops, livestock</p>
<p><strong>Geography</strong> temperate plains, volcanic mountains</p>
<p><strong>Fate</strong> decimated by civil war</p>
<p>The nation of Varceta was ran, primarily, by a family of vampires. Surprisingly benevolent to the citizens of the nation under the guidance of their queen, the head of the family, this supposed benevolence hid jealous politics behind closed doors. Fearing the queen would never give up her throne, her spoiled children began to conspire against her.</p>
<p>During the onset of the Cataclysm, the barons and counts realized that their extravagant way of life was threatened. They enacted their conspiracy, and the queen vanished without a trace. Further confusion ensued as each sibling and their families tried to lay claim to her throne, and civil war broke out. Quickly expending their undead work-force as disposable cannon fodder, the vampiric barons turned to their own mortal citizens as conscripted soldiers, ill trained and poorly organized. Several villages and castles were abandoned almost overnight as the citizenry rebelled against their uncaring aristocratic leaders, electing to flee in search of safer lands as the ancient vampires clung to their petty feud and crumbling kingdom’s past comforts.</p>
<p>The last corner of the kingdom to fall was the Darkwood Shire, a relatively peaceful rural village inhabited by gnomes, halflings, and sprites who valiantly defended themselves using spears made of darkwood. The vampires feared being staked by these brave farmers, but that fear eventually gave way to desperation, and the Darkwood Shire was buried among a heap of smallfolk bodies and vampire ashes.

<p><strong>Geography</strong> snowy coast and mountains</p>
<p><strong>Fate</strong> swallowed by the earth</p>
<p>Verndhelt was a highly xenophobic and amibitious empire that leveraged their heavily armored forces to conquer territory that the Iron Council demanded was theirs by right of might. Led by the divine-adjacent Knight Lords, these forces showed little mercy as their martial prowess fed the empire&#x27;s expansion. Children with potential to lead in the Empire&#x27;s Finest were scouted from ages as young as seven, and parents were paid a substantial stipend to turn their child over to the Iron Academies to learn how best they could serve their country. Citizens of Verndhelt could expect strict law enforcement, though activities within the bounds of law were encouraged, as the belief that beneficial destiny came to those who earned it with the toil of their back, but non-humans were ostricised by the nation&#x27;s culture, with tieflings treated especially poorly. The Hellknight orders originated in Verndhelt, tracing their existence to an ideological split that set them at odds with the Iron Council.</p>
<p>When the Cataclysm found Verndhelt, it came as a rumbling of the earth. The Iron Palace, the military academies, and most of their standing armies crumpled into the depths as a sinkhole swallowed the capital whole.

Taking the form of a plague referred to as &quot;mindrot,&quot; citizens gradually dropped dead in the streets, only to rise moments later as mindless husks that continued carrying out their menial tasks for some unseen purpose.

Aelia was one of the most worshiped gods in the world before the destruction. She was loved not only for bringing light and heat to the world daily without fail, but was also worshiped for her offers of redemption to those who asked for it. Aelia came to be at The Beginning. She started out as a floating consciousness shooting through the endless void. Aelia wished to slow down and think for some time and so she changed her form to that of a large sphere. Realizing that she could change her own form, she attempted to create other forms to accompany her and soon she had created nine other spheres of all different sizes. The void was cold, dark, and lonely though and Aelia wished to create friends to play with and as such, she implanted different personalities in them. Now the void wasn&#x27;t lonely, but it was still cold and dark. She created a fire so bright and hot and surrounded herself with it. Now there was light and heat, but it was too much for some of her friends, and so they had to move away from her, and this formed the Solar System with Aelia as the Sun, and her friends lined up continuously going circles around her. The planets are now worshiped as other gods with Aelia as their leader. Aelia&#x27;s clergy is generally very kind, passionate, warmhearted people and are known for healing those in need, no matter the personal cost, their truthfulness, and their endless patience.

A’shir was once a god of fate and time, a god of diviners, worshiped by those wishing to see a glimpse into their own futures. He worked closely with the other gods in order to keep order in the world. That is until one day A’shir revealed a grim prophecy, that he would one day turn against the gods, destroying them and all their creations. The gods quickly grew fearful of A’shirs prophecy and swiftly imprisoned him deep within the plane of fire where they thought none would ever survive long enough to set him free. For ages he was imprisoned, the flames of the realm searing his flesh, it was not long before his understanding gave way to anger. With each passing year his rage grew until it mixed with the potent magics in the realm of fire, transforming him into a beast of fire and hatred. Still bound by divine chains, A’shir now vows to destroy the other gods and all they have made for their crimes against him.ssionate, warmhearted people and are known for healing those in need, no matter the personal cost, their truthfulness, and their endless patience.

The Circle of Stars is a loose pantheon of celestial deities of both day and night. It is worshipped primarily by agrarian cultures who place heavy reliance on their community’s safety. They recognize the union of the sun, moon, and stars as important as the union between seed and soil. The sun provides their crops, the night provides their rest, while the moon and stars keep them lit well enough to keep watch over their fields. Different communities and individuals may value different gods or goddesses within the pantheon differently, placing a greater emphasis on love or celebration of newcomers, or on maintaining a purifying fire in the face of the undead. Regardless, those who worship The Circle of Stars form strong bonds with those around them, and will do anything to keep them safe.
<strong>Edicts</strong> foster community with bonds as bright as stars, heal the downtrodden, improve your talents for the sake of your community, celebrate your bonds regularly
<strong>Anathema</strong> turn away a weary or wounded traveler, allow harm to come to a member of your community through negligence, maintain bonds with those who do not honor yours.

Some say Golgolgoss came from the first sunbleached skull, others say they sprouted with the first tree, but those who know of the deity can agree they have been watching over the cycle of life and death from the beginning. Appearing as a giant figure shrouded in a cloak of leaves with a head made of many different skulls in the shape of a majestic moose skull, they stand vigil over nature&#x27;s role in the world. Despite their appearance and duties, they are a Jolly being with a laugh that sounds like dry leaves in the wind. Rarely appearing to civilization at all, this deity will teach those in wilderness to survive and create life, and that death is just as important as life and should not be feared. Even Undeath serves its role to Golgolgoss as the creation often leads to new soil brought to the surface, and their decay will continue to foster new life. Artificial constructs are considered an affront to the deity, being seen as a mockery of life that contributes nothing to its cycle.

The Grey Ocean is a place: a beach made of seaglass, a great sea full of silted water and the dissolving wreckage of soul matter as it decays and reforms and joins the cycle anew. When undead are created, material is removed from Her purview, damaging the tide of life and death. Great beasts lurk in Her depths, the psychopomps the easiest to understand among them, but greater things hiding somewhere beneath Her waves. She is a home to all, a cradle, a tomb. One day, She will crash in on herself, the placid water giving birth to something new, far beyond death and souls. She is the gateway, the path, and the resting place at the end of the road. She is the knife. She is the meal. She calls.

Its priests include crazed leshies and dryads bursting with putrefaction and vegetative tumors, a hollow sort of glee moving in their eyes. Some others, living in harsh and dangerous regions like Briarmurk, simply worship The Bloody Rose in hopes of gaining even a shred of its might.

Kohtalo is the goddess of ambitious souls. Being one of the oldest and initially, most obscure Goddesses, through her own efforts and the efforts of her followers she&#x27;s gained greater recognition. Kohtalo was a Goddess of dreams, who was often overshadowed by other deities, but through completing a set of several challenges and tasks she was granted greater influence and sway. Through this experience she gained an appreciation for ambition. She blesses those who seek to forge their own fate and defy the odds, especially underdogs. Unlike many deities that effect fate, she gets a great deal of amusement from those who don&#x27;t accept their fate and actively fight against it, often putting her end goals and involvement in the lives of mortals at odds with other fate deities. Kohtalo&#x27;s favored weapon is the pick, signifying the desire to create a new life and path for oneself. She resents anyone who chooses a life of complacency or takes advantage of those weaker then themselves as it poses no challenge and doesn&#x27;t better anyone.

Not a particularly well-known deity, Krun Darr is nevertheless deeply respected by those who know of them and admire their might. Their chosen form is remarkably variable, yet always reflects their own power, often versions of powerful creatures, but occasionally something less expected -- a stormcloud spanning the sky, an immense mechanical creation, or a mighty weapon built from metal. Regardless of their form, Krun Darr is invariably crackling with lightning and power, and tends to carry hints of blue and bronze coloring. This coloring has led to speculation of a connection to dragons and their deities, and indeed, both bronze and blue dragons are known to worship Krun Darr, while even those who do not worship them consider them a being who commands respect. Yet Krun Darr&#x27;s origins and connections to other deities are still not fully understood.

One of the eldest gods known to civilization, Kujani believes that he and his fellow divines have no more authority over souls than mortals do. Although he participated in the creation of mortal life, Kujani abandoned his children shortly after, leaving them with nothing but a decree that they should live to improve themselves for their own sakes, and a promise that he would free them in the afterlife for doing so.  Kujani has never answered a prayer, performed any miracles, or attempted to reach out to his followers in any way (beyond his last decree), believing mortal autonomy to be more sacred than his own power and influence. His clerics do not draw their powers directly from Kujani, but from a wellspring inside themselves that Kujanite philosophy unlocks. It is said than when a mortal dies, their soul stands before Kujani as he administers final judgment. Souls who dedicated their lives to the development of mortalkind are awarded eternal freedom from the whims of the gods, while souls who consigned themselves to divine enslavement are abandoned by Kujani, to be fought over by the other deities.

He expects his followers to seek out new experiences, enjoy existence and the partake in the pleasures it offers. The body is sacred to Lysanthyr and followers are expected to take care to preserve and perfect their bodies, for the body is the vessel by which the mind can derive pleasure from the world. To this end, he is associated with various cults of undeath and immortality. His worship rose to particular prominence in the nation of Varceta, where the ruling vampires often made sacrifices in his honour in hopes of being blessed with fleeting glimpses of their reflections. To know if Lysanthyr holds your heart you need only ask one question, ”Would you like to live deliciously?”

The Maiden of the Garden considers mortality to be a form of entertainment more so than anything else, lounging amongst her attendants as they view the goings on of humanity from her plane of Evermeadow. Before the Cataclysm, many prayers were sent her way from hopefuls desperate to find a lifelong relationship, widows desiring dreams of their loved ones, or parents hoping to use their children to marry upwards in society. If it suited her whim, the Maiden would occasionally grant these requests for matches and a match blessed by the Maiden would stand against all trials save for divine intervention. Occasionally these matches would be made out of spite or simply because she deemed it amusing… Oftentimes such matches are those you’d read of in history books. Ever since the world fell, prayers to the Maiden have dwindled, but thankfully affairs of the heart are never far from mortal thoughts. It would seem even in the darkest times, love finds a way.

As fickle as the tides he created, Noctune is a god who favors himself and not much else.

He is wholly unpredictable and has constant mood swings, appearing as wrathful as a stormy sea at one moment and as calm as a still sound the next. Those who follow him are instructed to share in Noctune&#x27;s anguish as much as they share in his joy, and will often go swimming on calm days or shut themselves off from the rest of the world when the seas are choppy and rough. While not widely worshipped among the more common humanoid races, many popular sailor sea shanties were adapted from hymns of Noctune. Some of Noctune&#x27;s followers interpret his changing moods as madness, and believe that the god is incapable of resting as long as landwalkers roam the seas. This cult of Noctune is worshipped by monstrous ocean creatures who would rather eat landwalkers than share the oceans with them, such as sirens.

Oenos&#x27; following has never seemed powerful, or organized, though you would be hard pressed to find a tavern without his likeness somewhere. His teachings, of which there are many, center around being a gracious host and a grateful guest as has always been his way.  These teachings seemingly passed down at random as priests encountered the god in varying states of drunkeness who only realized who had spoken it after they awoke the next day. This manner of divine intervention has always frustrated other more organized religions, some of which attribute the god to drunken hallucinations of innebriated priests and partygoers.

Self-proclaimed prince of everything that is, was, and will be fun in this world, Peko-Amuzo is the &quot;son&quot; of a terrifying amount of different fiends. Or so he says. How he was conceived remains a mystery, but this amalgamation of different kinds of evil has made him mighty and utterly chaotic — so much so that his power steadily decreases whenever he isn&#x27;t entertained. Therefore, he often tries to switch things up. That is the reason why he enjoys creation so much: there&#x27;s always something new and exciting to make! While he may seem somewhat reasonable at first, helpful, even, it turns out that he only gives his knowledge to those who will either entertain him greatly, or who simply have ill intent and will cause trouble.
He has declared being quarter-demon, which is partly why he was mostly worshipped in Garn. Whether this is accurate is uncertain — after all, he also claims to be the creator of many things like trees, hedonism, or even pancakes, but that is most likely a tactic to draw the ire of many — one of his favorite hobbies.

Riahn, twin deity to Trella, was once known as the God of the South Star. His role in the sky was to offer alternate paths of travel to Trella, but over time people viewed Trella as the guiding star, causing him to be viewed as the star that would lead travellers astray. One day, the South Star no longer gave its light, leaving a void in the sky. Riahn is still there, watching, but as he moves through the sky, he sometimes eclipses the light of the other stars, going unnoticed by many but for the few who worship him this is seen as a good omen. Worshippers of Riahn typically involve those who act unseen, but are most definitely there, doing backdoor deals and looking for that which is hidden in the dark.

The Den Mother is an ancient being who originally gained power due to the worship of warren dwelling Ysoki. She is a deity of earth, family, and crafting, usually depicted as either a matronly Ysoki woman or as a massive subterranean rat. Though still somewhat of a patron diety to many Ysoki clans, she has also become popular with all folk who live or travel beneath the surface, mine and utilize underground resources, or value strong familial ties. Her holy symbol is a rat, curled up as though sleeping in a snug den.

The eyes followers attempt to destroy the minds of others, for a broken mind serves as sustanance to The Eyes, although the followers do not know this.

The Living Mandate is an unseen manifestation of mortals&#x27; rejection of the natural world and all it entails. They have existed since the start of the very first civilization to stray from the wilds, to carve its place unto the world and rise above the rest, growing as more and more have followed. Called by many names or philosophies they exist as an ideal or guiding deity in various cultures. Long ago, many believed that they watched over all civilization, ensuring progress at any cost. Though lacking any major allegiances, they heavily favour those who seek to innovate, to change, to seize their destiny. They have come to be characterized by ambition, progress and liberty. However, there are always two sides to a coin and with unrestricted progress comes greed, destruction, war and more. Still, always, The Living Mandate always sides with unrestricted advancement regardless of consequences. Now their worshippers include a variety of individuals from all backgrounds, good or bad, each seeking to manifest their destiny.</p>

Amongst the younger deities of the world, the Three Sisters were not widespread worshiped in the land like other gods.  Those who did discovered them through their experiments and observations of the world.  Each Sister has their own interest, based on the three main areas of worship, but no one can tell each Sister apart as they are identical triplets with no individual names or styles.  Some outsiders believe that there is only one goddess, as most worshipers only ever meet one of the Sisters if they ever do something to earn their presence.  Only true scholars or heroes have met either two or all of the Sisters, usually when great discoveries have occurred.  Few know what their personalities are like, but they have been described as eager to learn and easily excited by new experiments and findings about the world.

Often depicted as a soldier armored in skulls and bones and a sword with his blade between his feet, Unmortus is revered as the god of eternal vigilance and the one who never fell. Long ago, in the beginnings of civilization, he was worshipped as a god of protection and the homeland and the protector of the heavens. He was restless and unyielding to his duty to the heavens, right until his unfortunate demise against a forgotten enemy. However, from his death, he rose again and kept his watch in unlife. Unfortunately, due to his new undead nature, his name fell into obscurity, with only a few nations knowing of him. Regardless, he keeps his vigil, even if the gods or mortals he protects despise him due to his nature.</p>
<p>His followers pledge their soul to the defense of their nation, and connect it to the realm of the dead so that they can be risen in order to defend the nation long after they have perished. Sometimes called bone lords, death knights, or the living dead, they are often looked upon with mistrust and sometimes open antagonism. Stoically, they press onward. They work forever for their homeland, their every breath in service of its defense.

When the first spell was uttered and the first runes were cast it created neither fire nor force; it created Xan’Zyk. As the first incantation entered the world, it did so in an avalanche of magical energy so potent that the spell itself gained not only sentience but also divinity. Xan’Zyk, named after the first two syllables of the primordial spell which birthed them, is the pursuit of magical power incarnate. They seek only to see magic used with little regard to the purpose it serves. They are just as content to see a fireball engulf a town square as they are to see a tyrannical lich disintegrated to ash. All spells are prayers to Xan’Zyk and it is said that with every spell uttered and every new ritual discovered their power expands. They are most commonly depicted as an ornate magical sigil or alternatively a spellbook shimmering with prismatic light. Xan’Zyk accepts the worship of any who can cast spells of their own power, however wizards in particular naturally gravitate towards The First Incantation. Legends claim that should the entirety of the incantation which birthed Xan’Zyk be uttered once more, they along with all spells which have followed them, would be undone.
